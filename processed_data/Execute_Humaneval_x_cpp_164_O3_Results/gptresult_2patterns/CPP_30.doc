### LLM Simulation:
- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `get_positive({-1, -2, 4, 5, 6})`.
- Step 2: The function processes the input set `{-1, -2, 4, 5, 6}` and filters out the positive numbers.
- Step 3: The positive numbers identified are `{4, 5, 6}`.
- Step 4: Compare the result with the expected set `{4, 5, 6}` using `issame`.
- Step 5: The sets match, so `issame` returns `true`.

**Final Output:**
true

**LLM Simulation:**

- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `get_positive({5, 3, -5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10})`.

- Step 2: The `get_positive` function processes the input set `{5, 3, -5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10}` and filters out non-positive numbers. This involves iterating through each element and selecting only the positive ones.

- Step 3: The positive elements in the set are `{5, 3, 2, 3, 3, 9, 123, 1}`. Since sets do not maintain order, the result from `get_positive` will be a set containing these positive numbers.

- Step 4: Now, we compare the result of `get_positive` with the set `{5, 3, 2, 3, 3, 9, 123, 1}`. The duplicates in the input set do not affect the final set since sets are collections of unique elements.

- Step 5: The elements in both sets are the same, meaning `issame` will return `true`.

**Final Output:**
true

**LLM Simulation:**
- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `get_positive({-1, -2})`.
- Step 2: The function processes the set `{-1, -2}` and filters out the positive numbers. Since there are no positive numbers in the set, the result is an empty set: `{}`.
- Step 3: Now, we compare the result `{}` with the expected output `{}` using the `issame` function.
- Step 4: Since both sets are empty, they match, and `issame` returns `true`.

**Final Output:**
true

### LLM Simulation for the Function Call

**Function Call:**
assert (issame(get_positive({}) , {}));

**Expected Result:**
get_positive({})

**LLM Simulation:**
- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `get_positive({})`.
- Step 2: The function `get_positive` is expected to return a set of positive elements from the input. Since the input set is empty (`{}`), there are no positive elements to retrieve.
- Step 3: Therefore, `get_positive({})` returns an empty set: `{}`.
- Step 4: Next, we need to compare the result of `get_positive({})` (which is `{}`) with the other empty set `{}` using `issame`.
- Step 5: The `issame` function checks if the two sets are identical. Since both are empty sets, they match.
- Step 6: As the sets match, `issame` returns `true`.

**Final Output:**
true
