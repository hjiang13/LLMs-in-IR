"assert (how_many_times("""", ""x"") == 0);",Fail,"- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `how_many_times("""", ""x"")`.
- Step 2: The function is designed to count how many times the substring `""x""` appears in the string `""""`.
- Step 3: Since the input string is empty, there are no occurrences of `""x""` in it.
- Step 4: The function returns `0`, which matches the expected result in the assert statement.

**Final Output:**
true"
"assert (how_many_times(""xyxyxyx"", ""x"") == 4);",Fail,"- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `how_many_times(""xyxyxyx"", ""x"")`.
- Step 2: The function scans the string ""xyxyxyx"" to count the occurrences of the character ""x"".
- Step 3: The character ""x"" appears in the string at the following positions: 1, 4, 6, and 7 (considering 1-based indexing).
- Step 4: Count the occurrences: there are 4 instances of ""x"" in total.
- Step 5: The function returns 4.

**Final Output:**
true"
"assert (how_many_times(""cacacacac"", ""cac"") == 4);",Fail,"### LLM Simulation for `how_many_times`

**Function Call:**
assert (how_many_times(""cacacacac"", ""cac"") == 4);

**Expected Result:**
4

**LLM Simulation:**
- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `how_many_times(""cacacacac"", ""cac"")`.
- Step 2: The function counts how many times the substring ""cac"" appears in the string ""cacacacac"".
- Step 3: Analyze the string:
  - The first occurrence starts at index 0: ""cac"".
  - The second occurrence starts at index 2: ""cac"".
  - The third occurrence starts at index 4: ""cac"".
  - The fourth occurrence starts at index 6: ""cac"".
- Step 4: There are a total of 4 non-overlapping occurrences of ""cac"" in ""cacacacac"".
- Step 5: The function returns the count, which is 4.

**Final Output:**
4"
"assert (how_many_times(""john doe"", ""john"") == 1);",Fail,"- **Step 1:** Simulate the IR-based function `how_many_times(""john doe"", ""john"")`.
- **Step 2:** The function needs to count how many times the substring ""john"" appears in the string ""john doe"". 
- **Step 3:** The substring ""john"" is found once at the beginning of the string.
- **Step 4:** Since ""john"" appears 1 time, the function returns 1.

**Final Output:**
true"
