- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `filter_by_substring({}, "john")`.
- Step 2: The function is designed to filter a collection (in this case, an empty dictionary or set) based on whether its elements contain the substring "john".
- Step 3: Since the input collection is empty, there are no elements to filter. Therefore, the result of the function will also be an empty collection.
- Step 4: The result of `filter_by_substring({}, "john")` is `{}`.
- Step 5: Now, compare the result with `{}` using the `issame` function. Since both are empty collections, they match.

**Final Output:**
true

**Function Call:**
assert (issame(filter_by_substring({"xxx", "asd", "xxy", "john doe", "xxxAAA", "xxx"}, "xxx"), {"xxx", "xxxAAA", "xxx"}));

**Expected Result:**
filter_by_substring({"xxx", "asd", "xxy", "john doe", "xxxaaa", "xxx"}, "xxx")

**LLM Simulation:**
- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `filter_by_substring({"xxx", "asd", "xxy", "john doe", "xxxAAA", "xxx"}, "xxx")`.
- Step 2: The function scans through the set `{"xxx", "asd", "xxy", "john doe", "xxxAAA", "xxx"}` and filters for elements that contain the substring `"xxx"`.
- Step 3: The elements that contain the substring `"xxx"` are `"xxx"`, `"xxxAAA"`, and `"xxx"`. Note that sets do not allow duplicate entries, so we only keep unique entries.
- Step 4: The result of the filtering process is `{"xxx", "xxxAAA"}`.
- Step 5: Now we compare this result with the set `{"xxx", "xxxAAA", "xxx"}` using `issame`.
- Step 6: The sets `{"xxx", "xxxAAA"}` and `{"xxx", "xxxAAA", "xxx"}` are considered equivalent because sets ignore duplicates and the contents match.

**Final Output:**
true

### Task Simulation

**Function Call:**
assert (issame(filter_by_substring({"xxx", "asd", "aaaxxy", "john doe", "xxxAAA", "xxx"}, "xx"),{"xxx", "aaaxxy", "xxxAAA", "xxx"}));

**Expected Result:**
filter_by_substring({"xxx", "asd", "aaaxxy", "john doe", "xxxaaa", "xxx"}, "xx")

**LLM Simulation:**
- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `filter_by_substring({"xxx", "asd", "aaaxxy", "john doe", "xxxAAA", "xxx"}, "xx")`.
- Step 2: The function iterates through each string in the set and checks if "xx" is a substring of each string.
    - "xxx" contains "xx" (include)
    - "asd" does not contain "xx" (exclude)
    - "aaaxxy" contains "xx" (include)
    - "john doe" does not contain "xx" (exclude)
    - "xxxAAA" contains "xx" (include)
    - "xxx" contains "xx" (include)
- Step 3: The resulting filtered set is `{"xxx", "aaaxxy", "xxxAAA", "xxx"}`.
- Step 4: Compare this result with the expected set `{"xxx", "aaaxxy", "xxxAAA", "xxx"}` using `issame`.
- Step 5: The sets match, so `issame` returns `true`.

**Final Output:**
true

### LLM Simulation:
- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `filter_by_substring({"grunt", "trumpet", "prune", "gruesome"}, "run")`.
- Step 2: The function filters the input set for strings that contain the substring "run".
    - Check "grunt": contains "run" (true).
    - Check "trumpet": does not contain "run" (false).
    - Check "prune": contains "run" (true).
    - Check "gruesome": does not contain "run" (false).
- Step 3: The filtered result is `{"grunt", "prune"}`.
- Step 4: Compare the result with `{"grunt", "prune"}` using `issame`.
- Step 5: The sets match, so `issame` returns `true`.

**Final Output:**
true
