**Calculating Fibonacci Sequence:**
- The Fibonacci sequence starts with `F(0) = 0`, `F(1) = 1`.

Calculating up to `F(9)`:
- `F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1`
- `F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2`
- `F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3`

**Checking if 34 is Prime:**
- A prime number is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

  - 34 is even, hence divisible by 2.
  
Since 34 is divisible by 2, it is not a prime number.
