assert (truncate_number(3.5) == 0.5);,Fail,"- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `truncate_number(3.5)`.
- Step 2: The function is designed to truncate the decimal part of the number. In this case, truncating 3.5 will result in removing the integer part (3) and leaving the decimal part (0.5).
- Step 3: The result of the truncation is 0.5.
- Step 4: Compare the result with the expected value of 0.5 using the assert statement.

**Final Output:**
true"
