"assert (issame(rolling_max({1, 2, 3, 4}) , {1, 2, 3, 4}));",Fail,"To simulate the execution of the function call in the assert statement, we will follow a structured approach similar to the examples provided.

### Function Call:
assert (issame(rolling_max({1, 2, 3, 4}), {1, 2, 3, 4}));

### Expected Result:
rolling_max({1, 2, 3, 4})

### LLM Simulation:
- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `rolling_max({1, 2, 3, 4})`.
- Step 2: The `rolling_max` function computes the maximum value in a rolling manner for the given set of numbers. Since the input is an ordered set from 1 to 4, the rolling maximum would be computed as follows:
  - For the first element (1), the maximum is 1.
  - For the second element (2), the maximum is 2.
  - For the third element (3), the maximum is 3.
  - For the fourth element (4), the maximum is 4.
- Step 3: Therefore, the rolling maximum for the set `{1, 2, 3, 4}` would yield the output `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.
- Step 4: The result from `rolling_max({1, 2, 3, 4})` is `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.
- Step 5: Now, we compare this result using the `issame` function with the expected output `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.
- Step 6: Since both sets match, the `issame` function will return `true`.

**Final Output:**
true"
"assert (issame(rolling_max({4, 3, 2, 1}),{4, 4, 4, 4}));",Fail,"To simulate the execution of the function call in the assert statement, we will follow similar steps as outlined in the previous examples. 

### Function Call:
assert (issame(rolling_max({4, 3, 2, 1}), {4, 4, 4, 4}));

### LLM Simulation:
- **Step 1:** Simulate the IR-based function `rolling_max({4, 3, 2, 1})`.
    - The `rolling_max` function computes the maximum value in a rolling manner over the input set.
    - Since the set `{4, 3, 2, 1}` is processed in order, it will consider the maximum of all previous elements as it moves through the set.
    
- **Step 2:** Compute the rolling maximum for the provided input.
    - At index 0, the maximum is `4`.
    - At index 1, the maximum of `{4, 3}` is `4`.
    - At index 2, the maximum of `{4, 3, 2}` is `4`.
    - At index 3, the maximum of `{4, 3, 2, 1}` is `4`.
    
    Therefore, the result of `rolling_max({4, 3, 2, 1})` is `{4, 4, 4, 4}`.

- **Step 3:** Now, we compare the result from `rolling_max` with the second set provided in the function call, which is `{4, 4, 4, 4}`.
    - The sets match, as both contain the same elements.

- **Step 4:** Since the sets are the same, we can conclude that `issame(rolling_max({4, 3, 2, 1}), {4, 4, 4, 4})` will return `true`.

- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `rolling_max({3, 2, 3, 100, 3})`.
- Step 2: The function calculates the rolling maximum of the input set. It processes the elements one by one:
  - Start with an initial maximum of `-âˆž`.
  - For the first element `3`, the maximum becomes `3`.
  - For the second element `2`, the maximum remains `3`.
  - For the third element `3`, the maximum remains `3`.
  - For the fourth element `100`, the maximum updates to `100`.
  - For the fifth element `3`, the maximum remains `100`.
- Step 3: The rolling maximum results in the sequence `[3, 3, 3, 100, 100]`, reflecting the maximum value encountered at each step.
- Step 4: Compare the result with `{3, 3, 3, 100, 100}` using `issame`. Since the rolling maximum matches the expected output, the function returns `true`.

**Final Output:**
true"
