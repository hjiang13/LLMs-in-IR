### LLM Simulation:
- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `sort_even({1, 2, 3})`.
- Step 2: The function `sort_even` is expected to sort only the even numbers from the input set. In the set `{1, 2, 3}`, the even number is `2`.
- Step 3: Since `sort_even` should return the even numbers sorted in ascending order, it results in the set `{2}`.
- Step 4: Now, we compare the result `{2}` with the expected set `{1, 2, 3}` using the `issame` function.
- Step 5: The sets do not match since `{2}` is not equal to `{1, 2, 3}`.

**Final Output:**
false

### LLM Simulation for the Function Call

**Function Call:**
assert (issame(sort_even({5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10}), {-10, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 5, 0, 9, 1, 123}));

**Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `sort_even({5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10})`.**

- The input set is `{5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10}`.
- Identify the even numbers from the set: The even numbers are `2`, `0`, and `-10`.
- Sort the identified even numbers: When sorted, they yield `[-10, 0, 2]`.
- The odd numbers are `5`, `3`, `-5`, `-3`, `3`, `9`, `123`, `1`.
- The odd numbers remain in the same order in the original set since sorting is only applied to the even numbers.

**Step 2: Construct the final output from the sorted even numbers.**
- After sorting, replace the even numbers in the original set with the sorted even numbers, while maintaining the positions of the odd numbers.
- The resulting structure would be: `{-10, 3, -5, 0, -3, 3, 2, 5, 9, 1, 123}`.

**Step 3: Compare the result with `{-10, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 5, 0, 9, 1, 123}` using `issame`.**
- The output of `sort_even` is `{-10, 3, -5, 0, -3, 3, 2, 5, 9, 1, 123}`.
- The expected set `{-10, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 5, 0, 9, 1, 123}` contains different values in different positions.
- Therefore, the two sets are not the same.

**Final Output:**
false

To simulate the execution of the function call in the assert statement, let's break down the task step by step:

### Function Call
```plaintext
assert (issame(sort_even({5, 8, -12, 4, 23, 2, 3, 11, 12, -10}), {-12, 8, 3, 4, 5, 2, 12, 11, 23, -10}));
```

### Expected Result
The expected result is the output of the function `sort_even({5, 8, -12, 4, 23, 2, 3, 11, 12, -10})`.

### Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `sort_even`
1. **Input Set**: `{5, 8, -12, 4, 23, 2, 3, 11, 12, -10}`
2. **Identify Even Numbers**:
   - The even numbers in the input set are `8`, `-12`, `4`, `2`, `12`, `-10`.
3. **Sort Even Numbers**: 
   - Sorting these even numbers gives us: `[-12, -10, 2, 4, 8, 12]`.
4. **Return the Result**: 
   - The `sort_even` function returns the sorted even numbers.

### Step 2: Compare with the Expected Set
- The output of `sort_even` is `[-12, -10, 2, 4, 8, 12]`.
- The expected set in the assert statement is `{-12, 8, 3, 4, 5, 2, 12, 11, 23, -10}`.

### Step 3: Execute `issame`
- To execute `issame`, we need to check if the sorted list of even numbers matches the expected set.
- The expected set contains both even and odd numbers, and since we only care about the even numbers, the check is about the even numbers.

### Final Step: Conclusion
- Since the even numbers `[-12, -10, 2, 4, 8, 12]` do not match the set that includes odd numbers `3`, `5`, `11`, and `23`, the `issame` function will return `false`.

### Final Output
The final result of executing the assert statement is:
```plaintext
false
```
