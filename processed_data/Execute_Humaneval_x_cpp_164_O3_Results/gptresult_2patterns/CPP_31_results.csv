assert (is_prime(13441) == true);,Fail,"### LLM Simulation for `is_prime(13441)`

**Step 1:** Simulate the IR-based function `is_prime(13441)`.

**Step 2:** To determine if 13441 is a prime number, the function checks if 13441 has any divisors other than 1 and itself. 

**Step 3:** The algorithm typically checks for divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number (which is approximately 116.1 for 13441). It will iterate through possible divisors:

- Check divisibility by 2: 13441 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
- Check divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits (1 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 13) is not divisible by 3.
- Check divisibility by 4: 13441 is not divisible by 4.
- Continue checking divisibility for all odd numbers up to 116.

assert (is_prime(5 * 17) == false);,Pass,"To simulate the execution of the function call `is_prime(5 * 17)`, let's break down the steps based on the provided IR code.

### LLM Simulation:
- **Step 1**: Calculate the argument for `is_prime`. The expression `5 * 17` evaluates to `85`.
  
- **Step 2**: Now we need to check if `85` is a prime number using the `is_prime` function.
  
- **Step 3**: A number is considered prime if it is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself. We need to check divisibility for numbers from 2 up to the square root of 85 (which is approximately 9.22). Therefore, we will check divisibility by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

- **Step 4**: 
  - 85 is not divisible by 2 (85 is odd).
  - 85 is not divisible by 3 (the sum of digits, 8 + 5 = 13, is not divisible by 3).
  - 85 is not divisible by 4 (85 divided by 4 gives a non-integer).
  - 85 is divisible by 5 (85 divided by 5 equals 17).
  
Since 85 has a divisor other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.

- **Step 5**: The `is_prime` function would return `false` for the input `85`.

- **Step 6**: Finally, we compare the result of `is_prime(85)` with `false` using the assert statement. The result matches, so the assertion holds true.

- Step 5: Since `77` has divisors other than `1` and `77`, it is not a prime number.
