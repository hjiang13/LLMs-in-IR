"assert (add(0, 1) == 1);",Fail,"**LLM Simulation:**
- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `add(0, 1)`.
- Step 2: The function is defined to take two integer inputs and return their sum.
- Step 3: Calculate the sum: 0 + 1 = 1.
- Step 4: The result of `add(0, 1)` is 1, which matches the expected value in the assert statement.

**Final Output:**
true"
"assert (add(1, 0) == 1);",Fail,"- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `add(1, 0)`.
- Step 2: The function takes two parameters, 1 and 0. 
- Step 3: It performs the addition operation: 1 + 0 = 1.
- Step 4: The result of the addition is 1, which matches the expected result of the assert statement.

**Final Output:**

"assert (add(2, 3) == 5);",Fail,"- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `add(2, 3)`.
- Step 2: The function performs the addition operation: 2 + 3.
- Step 3: The result of the addition is 5.
- Step 4: Compare the result with the expected value 5 using the assert statement.

**Final Output:**
