assert (sum_to_n(1) == 1);,Fail,"### LLM Simulation for `sum_to_n(1)`

- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `sum_to_n(1)`.
- Step 2: The function calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 1. Since the only integer in this range is 1, the sum is simply 1.
- Step 3: The result of the function `sum_to_n(1)` is 1.
- Step 4: Compare the result with the expected value of 1 using the assert statement.
- Step 5: Since the calculated result (1) matches the expected result (1), the assertion is successful.

**Final Output:**
true"
assert (sum_to_n(6) == 21);,Fail,"To simulate the execution of the function call `sum_to_n(6)`, let's walk through the steps as outlined in the previous examples.

### Step-by-Step Simulation of `sum_to_n(6)`

1. **Step 1:** Simulate the IR-based function `sum_to_n(6)`.
2. **Step 2:** The function `sum_to_n(n)` is intended to compute the sum of all integers from 1 to `n`. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6
   \]
   - Breaking it down:
     - \(1 + 2 = 3\)
     - \(3 + 3 = 6\)
     - \(6 + 4 = 10\)
     - \(10 + 5 = 15\)
     - \(15 + 6 = 21\)

3. **Step 3:** The result of `sum_to_n(6)` is calculated to be `21`.

4. **Step 4:** Now we compare the result with the expected value from the assert statement:
   \[
   sum_to_n(6) == 21
   \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal (both result in `21`), the assertion holds true.

### Final Output
The assertion evaluates to true because the calculated sum matches the expected value.

**Final Output:**
true"
assert (sum_to_n(11) == 66);,Fail,"### LLM Simulation:

- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `sum_to_n(11)`.
- Step 2: The function calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 11.
  - This can be done using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
- Step 3: Plugging in the value \( n = 11 \):
  - \( \text{Sum} = \frac{11 \times (11 + 1)}{2} = \frac{11 \times 12}{2} = \frac{132}{2} = 66 \).
- Step 4: The result of `sum_to_n(11)` is 66, which matches the expected value in the assert statement.

**Final Output:**
true"
assert (sum_to_n(30) == 465);,Fail,"**Function Call:**
assert (sum_to_n(30) == 465);

**Expected Result:**
true

**LLM Simulation:**
- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `sum_to_n(30)`.
- Step 2: The function calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 30 using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers: \( \text{Sum} = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
- Step 3: Plugging in the value, we compute: 
  \[
  \text{Sum} = \frac{30 \times (30 + 1)}{2} = \frac{30 \times 31}{2} = \frac{930}{2} = 465.
  \]
- Step 4: The result of `sum_to_n(30)` is 465, which matches the expected value in the assert statement.

**Final Output:**

assert (sum_to_n(100) == 5050);,Fail,"### LLM Simulation:

- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `sum_to_n(100)`.
- Step 2: The function calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 100. This can be done using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers: 
  \[
  \text{sum} = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
  \]
  For `n = 100`, the calculation would be:
  \[
  \text{sum} = \frac{100 \times (100 + 1)}{2} = \frac{100 \times 101}{2} = \frac{10100}{2} = 5050
  \]
- Step 3: The result of `sum_to_n(100)` is 5050.
- Step 4: Compare the result with the expected value 5050 in the assert statement.
- Step 5: Since the calculated sum (5050) matches the expected result (5050), the assertion is true.

true"
