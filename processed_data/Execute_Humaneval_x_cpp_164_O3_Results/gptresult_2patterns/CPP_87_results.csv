"assert (issame(get_row({}, 1) , {}));",Fail,"### LLM Simulation:

- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `get_row({}, 1)`.
- Step 2: The function `get_row` is expected to retrieve a specific row from a structure represented as a dictionary (or similar). Given that the input is an empty dictionary `{}` and the row index is `1`, it implies that there are no rows to retrieve.
- Step 3: Since the input is an empty structure, the function will return an empty dictionary `{}`.
- Step 4: Now, compare the result with the expected output `{}` using the `issame` function.
- Step 5: The sets match because both are empty dictionaries.

**Final Output:**
true"
"assert (issame(get_row({{1}}, 2) , {}));",Fail,"### LLM Simulation:
- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `get_row({{1}}, 2)`.
- Step 2: The function `get_row` is expected to retrieve a specific row from a 2D structure, where `{{1}}` indicates a 2D array with one row containing a single element `1`, and `2` indicates the row index requested.
- Step 3: Since the indexing is typically zero-based in many programming contexts, the request for row `2` would go beyond the available rows, which only contains row `0`.
- Step 4: The function likely returns an empty collection (e.g., `[]` or `{}`) because there is no row `2` in the 2D structure `{{1}}`.
- Step 5: The assertion checks if the result of `get_row({{1}}, 2)` is equal to `{}` (an empty set).
- Step 6: Since the result of the function matches the expected empty set, the assertion is satisfied.

**Final Output:**
true"
