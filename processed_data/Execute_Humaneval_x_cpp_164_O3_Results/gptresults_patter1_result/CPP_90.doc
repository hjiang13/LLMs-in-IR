- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `next_smallest({1, 2, 3, 4, 5})`.
- Step 2: The function is designed to find the smallest element in the set that is greater than the minimum element.
- Step 3: Identify the minimum element in the set `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`, which is `1`.
- Step 4: The next smallest element greater than `1` in the set is `2`.
- Step 5: The function returns `2`.

**Final Output:**
true

- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `next_smallest({5, 1, 4, 3, 2})`.
- Step 2: The function identifies the smallest element in the set, which is `1`.
- Step 3: It then looks for the next smallest element greater than `1`, which is `2`.
- Step 4: The result of `next_smallest` is `2`.

**Final Output:**
true

- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `next_smallest({1, 1, 1, 1, 0})`.
- Step 2: The function needs to identify the smallest number in the set. In this case, the set `{1, 1, 1, 1, 0}` has the elements 1 and 0.
- Step 3: The smallest element is 0. However, since the goal is to find the next smallest element larger than the smallest (0), we look for the next distinct number in the set after 0.
- Step 4: The next largest number after 0 in the set is 1.
- Step 5: The function returns 1.

**Final Output:**
1
