assert (sum_to_n(1) == 1);,Fail,"- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `sum_to_n(1)`.
- Step 2: The function calculates the sum of integers from 1 to 1, which is simply 1.
- Step 3: The result matches the expected sum, which is 1.
- Step 4: Since the computed result (1) is equal to the expected result (1), the function returns `true`.

**Final Output:**
true"
assert (sum_to_n(6) == 21);,Fail,"### LLM Simulation:
- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `sum_to_n(6)`.
- Step 2: The function calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 6. This can be done using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers: \( \text{sum} = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
- Step 3: Substituting \( n = 6 \) into the formula:
  \[
  \text{sum} = \frac{6(6 + 1)}{2} = \frac{6 \times 7}{2} = \frac{42}{2} = 21
  \]
- Step 4: The result of `sum_to_n(6)` is 21, which matches the expected value in the assert statement.

**Final Output:**
true"
assert (sum_to_n(11) == 66);,Fail,"### LLM Simulation:

- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `sum_to_n(11)`.
- Step 2: The function calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 11. This can be done using the formula for the sum of the first n integers, which is \( \text{Sum} = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
- Step 3: Applying the formula for \( n = 11 \):
  \[
  \text{Sum} = \frac{11 \times (11 + 1)}{2} = \frac{11 \times 12}{2} = \frac{132}{2} = 66
  \]
- Step 4: The result of `sum_to_n(11)` is 66, which matches the expected value in the assert statement.

**Final Output:**
true"
assert (sum_to_n(30) == 465);,Fail,"- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `sum_to_n(30)`.
- Step 2: The function calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 30. This can be done using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is \( S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
- Step 3: Plugging in 30 into the formula gives us \( S = \frac{30(30 + 1)}{2} = \frac{30 \times 31}{2} = \frac{930}{2} = 465 \).
- Step 4: The result of `sum_to_n(30)` is 465, which matches the expected value in the assert statement.

**Final Output:**
true"
assert (sum_to_n(100) == 5050);,Fail,"- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `sum_to_n(100)`.
- Step 2: The function calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 100. This can be done using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers: \( \text{Sum} = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
- Step 3: Plugging in \( n = 100 \):
  \[
  \text{Sum} = \frac{100(100 + 1)}{2} = \frac{100 \times 101}{2} = \frac{10100}{2} = 5050.
  \]
- Step 4: The result of `sum_to_n(100)` is 5050, which matches the value in the assert statement (`== 5050`).

**Final Output:**
true"
