"assert (add({4, 88}) == 88);",Pass,"- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `add({4, 88})`.
- Step 2: The function `add` is expected to compute the sum of the elements in the set `{4, 88}`.
- Step 3: Calculate the sum: 4 + 88 = 92.
- Step 4: The result of the sum (92) does not match the expected value (88) specified in the assert statement.

**Final Output:**
false"
"assert (add({4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 122}) == 122);",Fail,"- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `add({4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 122})`.
- Step 2: The `add` function is expected to compute the maximum value from the set of numbers provided.
- Step 3: The maximum value in the set `{4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 122}` is `122`.
- Step 4: Compare the result with `122` using the assert statement.

Since the result of `add({4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 122})` is indeed `122`, the assertion holds true.

**Final Output:**
true"
"assert (add({4, 0, 6, 7}) == 0);",Pass,"### LLM Simulation:
- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `add({4, 0, 6, 7})`.
- Step 2: The function is designed to take a set of numbers and calculate their sum. 
- Step 3: Calculate the sum of the elements in the set: 4 + 0 + 6 + 7 = 17.
- Step 4: Compare the result with the expected output, which is 0. Since 17 does not equal 0, the assertion fails.

**Final Output:**
false"
"assert (add({4, 4, 6, 8}) == 12);",Pass,"- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `add({4, 4, 6, 8})`.
- Step 2: The `add` function is expected to sum the unique elements in the set `{4, 4, 6, 8}`. In a set, duplicates are ignored, so the effective set is `{4, 6, 8}`.
- Step 3: Calculate the sum: 4 + 6 + 8 = 18.
- Step 4: The result, 18, does not match the expected value of 12.

**Final Output:**
false"
