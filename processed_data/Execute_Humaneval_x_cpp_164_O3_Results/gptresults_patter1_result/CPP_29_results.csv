"assert (issame(filter_by_prefix({}, ""john"") , {}));",Fail,"### LLM Simulation:
- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `filter_by_prefix({}, ""john"")`.
- Step 2: The input is an empty map (or dictionary) and a string prefix ""john"".
- Step 3: Since the input map is empty, there are no keys to filter based on the prefix.
- Step 4: Therefore, the output of `filter_by_prefix({}, ""john"")` will also be an empty map `{}`.
- Step 5: Now, compare the result with the expected output `{}` using `issame`.
- Step 6: The two outputs match as both are empty maps, so `issame` returns `true`.

**Final Output:**
true"
"assert (issame(filter_by_prefix({""xxx"", ""asd"", ""xxy"", ""john doe"", ""xxxAAA"", ""xxx""}, ""xxx"") , {""xxx"", ""xxxAAA"", ""xxx""}));",Fail,"**LLM Simulation:**

- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `filter_by_prefix({""xxx"", ""asd"", ""xxy"", ""john doe"", ""xxxAAA"", ""xxx""}, ""xxx"")`.
  
- Step 2: The function filters the input set to include only the strings that start with the prefix ""xxx"". 

- Step 3: The filtering process checks each element:
  - ""xxx"" starts with ""xxx"" → included
  - ""asd"" does not start with ""xxx"" → excluded
  - ""xxy"" does not start with ""xxx"" → excluded
  - ""john doe"" does not start with ""xxx"" → excluded
  - ""xxxAAA"" starts with ""xxx"" → included
  - ""xxx"" (again) starts with ""xxx"" → included

- Step 4: After filtering, the resulting set is `{""xxx"", ""xxxAAA"", ""xxx""}`.

- Step 5: Now we compare the result `{""xxx"", ""xxxAAA"", ""xxx""}` with the expected set `{""xxx"", ""xxxAAA"", ""xxx""}` using `issame`.

- Step 6: The sets match (as sets are unordered collections), so `issame` returns `true`.

**Final Output:**
true"
