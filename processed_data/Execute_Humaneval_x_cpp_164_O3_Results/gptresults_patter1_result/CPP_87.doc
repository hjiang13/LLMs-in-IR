Failed to parse the assert statement

- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `get_row({}, 1)`.
- Step 2: Since the input is an empty dictionary `{}` and the row index is `1`, the function attempts to retrieve the first row from the empty dictionary.
- Step 3: In this case, there are no rows in the empty dictionary to retrieve, so the function returns an empty dictionary `{}`.
- Step 4: Now we compare the result of `get_row({}, 1)` which is `{}` with the expected output which is also `{}` using the `issame` function.
- Step 5: Since both results are identical (both are empty dictionaries), the `issame` function will return `true`.

**Final Output:**
true

### LLM Simulation of the IR-based Function Call

**Function Call:**
assert (issame(get_row({{1}}, 2), {}));

**Expected Result:**
get_row({{1}}, 2)

**LLM Simulation Steps:**

- **Step 1:** Simulate the IR-based function `get_row({{1}}, 2)`.
    - The input is a 2D array (or matrix) with one row containing the single element `1`, and the row index requested is `2`.

- **Step 2:** Determine the structure of the input. The matrix `{{1}}` has only one row (index `0`), so the function checks if the requested row index (`2`) is valid.

- **Step 3:** Since the index `2` exceeds the number of rows in the matrix (which is `1`), `get_row({{1}}, 2)` will return an empty set or array, represented as `{}`.

- **Step 4:** Now, we compare the result of `get_row({{1}}, 2)` which is `{}` with the expected value `{}` using the `issame` function.

- **Step 5:** The `issame` function checks if both sets or arrays are equivalent. In this case, both results are empty, which means they are the same.

- **Step 6:** Since the sets match, `issame` returns `true`.

**Final Output:**
true
