"assert (issame(filter_by_substring({}, ""john""),{}));",Fail,"- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `filter_by_substring({}, ""john"")`.
- Step 2: The function takes a dictionary (in this case, an empty dictionary `{}`) and a substring `""john""`. 
- Step 3: Since the input dictionary is empty, there are no entries to filter based on the substring. Therefore, the output of the function will also be an empty dictionary `{}`.
- Step 4: The assertion checks if the output of `filter_by_substring({}, ""john"")` is equal to `{}`. Since both are empty dictionaries, the assertion holds true.

**Final Output:**
true"
"assert (issame(filter_by_substring({""xxx"", ""asd"", ""xxy"", ""john doe"", ""xxxAAA"", ""xxx""}, ""xxx""), {""xxx"", ""xxxAAA"", ""xxx""}));",Fail,"### LLM Simulation

- **Step 1:** Simulate the IR-based function `filter_by_substring({""xxx"", ""asd"", ""xxy"", ""john doe"", ""xxxAAA"", ""xxx""}, ""xxx"")`.

- **Step 2:** The function checks each string in the input set to see if it contains the substring ""xxx"":
  - ""xxx"" contains ""xxx"" → included
  - ""asd"" does not contain ""xxx"" → excluded
  - ""xxy"" does not contain ""xxx"" → excluded
  - ""john doe"" does not contain ""xxx"" → excluded
  - ""xxxAAA"" contains ""xxx"" → included
  - ""xxx"" contains ""xxx"" → included

- **Step 3:** The resulting set of strings that contain the substring ""xxx"" is `{""xxx"", ""xxxAAA"", ""xxx""}`. Note that sets do not allow for duplicates, so ""xxx"" appears only once.

- **Step 4:** Compare the result with `{""xxx"", ""xxxAAA"", ""xxx""}` using `issame`. Since both sets are equivalent, `issame` will return `true`.

**Final Output:**
true"

- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `filter_by_substring({""xxx"", ""asd"", ""aaaxxy"", ""john doe"", ""xxxAAA"", ""xxx""}, ""xx"")`.
- Step 2: The function checks each string in the set to see if it contains the substring ""xx"".
    - ""xxx"" contains ""xx"".

- Step 3: The filtered result based on the substring ""xx"" is `{""xxx"", ""aaaxxy"", ""xxxAAA"", ""xxx""}`.
- Step 4: Now, compare the filtered result with the expected set `{""xxx"", ""aaaxxy"", ""xxxAAA"", ""xxx""}` using `issame`.
- Step 5: Since both sets are equal, the `issame` function returns `true`.

"assert (issame(filter_by_substring({""grunt"", ""trumpet"", ""prune"", ""gruesome""}, ""run"") ,{""grunt"", ""prune""}));",Fail,"**LLM Simulation:**
- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `filter_by_substring({""grunt"", ""trumpet"", ""prune"", ""gruesome""}, ""run"")`.
- Step 2: The function will iterate through each element in the set `{""grunt"", ""trumpet"", ""prune"", ""gruesome""}` and check if the substring `""run""` is present in each element.
- Step 3: 
  - Check ""grunt"": contains ""run"" → yes.
  - Check ""trumpet"": contains ""run"" → no.
  - Check ""prune"": contains ""run"" → yes.
  - Check ""gruesome"": contains ""run"" → no.
- Step 4: The elements that contain the substring ""run"" are `""grunt""` and `""prune""`.
- Step 5: Thus, the function returns `{""grunt"", ""prune""}`.

- Step 6: Now compare the result `{""grunt"", ""prune""}` with the expected set `{""grunt"", ""prune""}` using `issame`.
- Step 7: The sets match, so `issame` returns `true`.

**Final Output:**
true"
