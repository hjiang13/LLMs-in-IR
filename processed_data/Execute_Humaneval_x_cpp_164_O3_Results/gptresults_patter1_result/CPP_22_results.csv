"assert (issame(filter_integers({}),{}));",Fail,"**LLM Simulation:**

- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `filter_integers({})`.
- Step 2: The function is designed to filter out integers from the input collection. Since the input is an empty set `{}`, there are no integers to filter.
- Step 3: The result of `filter_integers({})` is therefore also an empty set `{}`.
- Step 4: The assert statement checks if `issame({}, {})` evaluates to true.
- Step 5: Since both sets are empty and contain no elements, they are indeed the same.

**Final Output:**
true"

"assert (issame(filter_integers({3, 'c', 3, 3, 'a', 'b'}) ,{3, 3, 3}));",Fail,"- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `filter_integers({3, 'c', 3, 3, 'a', 'b'})`.
- Step 2: The function processes the input set `{3, 'c', 3, 3, 'a', 'b'}` and filters out non-integer elements. 
- Step 3: The resulting collection after filtering would be `{3, 3, 3}`, which can be interpreted as a multiset containing three occurrences of the integer 3.
- Step 4: Now we compare the result `{3, 3, 3}` with the expected output `{3, 3, 3}` using the `issame` function.
- Step 5: Since both sets contain the same integer value 3 with the same multiplicity, `issame` returns `true`.

**Final Output:**
true"
