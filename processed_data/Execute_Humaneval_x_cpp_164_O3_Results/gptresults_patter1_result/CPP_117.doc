- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4)`.
- Step 2: The function processes the input string, converting it to lowercase: "mary had a little lamb".
- Step 3: It then splits the string into individual words: `["mary", "had", "a", "little", "lamb"]`.
- Step 4: The function filters these words to find those with exactly 4 letters. The only word that meets this criterion is "lamb".
- Step 5: The result of `select_words` is `{"lamb"}`.
- Step 6: Compare the result `{"lamb"}` with the expected set `{"little"}` using `issame`.
- Step 7: The sets do not match, so `issame` returns `false`.

**Final Output:**
false

**Function Call:**
assert (issame(select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3) , {"Mary", "lamb"} ));

**Expected Result:**
true

**LLM Simulation:**
- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3)`.
- Step 2: The function processes the input string and splits it into words: `["Mary", "had", "a", "little", "lamb"]`.
- Step 3: It then filters the words based on their length, selecting only those that have exactly 3 characters. In this case, it finds the words "Mary" (4 characters) and "lamb" (4 characters).
- Step 4: Since "had" (3 characters) is not included in the expected output, the actual set of selected words is `{"had"}`.
- Step 5: Now, it compares the result `{"had"}` with the expected set `{"Mary", "lamb"}` using `issame`.
- Step 6: The sets do not match, so `issame` returns `false`.

**Final Output:**
false

- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `select_words("simple white space", 2)`.
- Step 2: The function is expected to select words from the input string based on the given condition. In this case, it likely selects words that have a length greater than or equal to 2 characters.
- Step 3: The words in the string "simple white space" are split into: `["simple", "white", "space"]`.
- Step 4: All the words have lengths greater than or equal to 2, so the function returns the set of selected words: `{"simple", "white", "space"}`.
- Step 5: Compare the result with the expected output `{}` using `issame`.
- Step 6: The sets do not match (the result is not empty), so `issame` returns `false`.

**Final Output:**
false

### Function Call:
assert (issame(select_words("Hello world", 4), {"world"}));

### Expected Result:
select_words("hello world", 4)

### LLM Simulation:
- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `select_words("Hello world", 4)`.
- Step 2: The function processes the input string "Hello world" and looks for words with exactly 4 letters.
- Step 3: The word "Hello" has 5 letters and "world" has 5 letters. Therefore, there are no words with exactly 4 letters in the input.
- Step 4: Since there are no matching words, the result of `select_words("Hello world", 4)` is an empty set `set()`.
- Step 5: Now, compare the result with `{"world"}` using `issame`.
- Step 6: The empty set does not match with `{"world"}`. Hence, `issame` returns `false`.

**Final Output:**
false

- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `select_words("Uncle sam", 3)`.
- Step 2: The function processes the input string, converting it to lowercase, resulting in "uncle sam".
- Step 3: The function splits the string into words: `["uncle", "sam"]`.
- Step 4: It then selects words based on their length. In this case, it will select words that have a length of 3 or more characters.
- Step 5: The word "uncle" has 6 characters and meets the criteria, while "sam" has 3 characters and also meets the criteria. However, the function only returns words that have exactly 3 characters or longer if specified.
- Step 6: The output of the function is `{"uncle", "sam"}`.
- Step 7: Now we compare the result with `{"Uncle"}`. Since `{"uncle", "sam"}` does not match `{"Uncle"}`, the `issame` function will return `false`.

**Final Output:**
false

### LLM Simulation for the Function Call:

**Function Call:**
assert (issame(select_words("", 4), {}));

**Expected Result:**
select_words("", 4)

**LLM Simulation:**
- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `select_words("", 4)`.
- Step 2: The function `select_words` is designed to select words from a given string based on a specified word length (in this case, 4). Since the input string is empty (`""`), there are no words to select.
- Step 3: As a result, `select_words("", 4)` will return an empty set (or an empty collection).
- Step 4: Now, we compare the result of `select_words("", 4)` (which is `{}`) with the expected empty set `{}` using the `issame` function.
- Step 5: Since both results are empty, the sets match, so `issame` returns `true`.

**Final Output:**
true

### LLM Simulation:
- **Step 1:** Simulate the IR-based function `select_words("a b c d e f", 1)`.
- **Step 2:** The function processes the input string "a b c d e f" and splits it into words: `["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"]`.
- **Step 3:** The function selects words based on the index provided (1 in this case). This means it selects every word starting from index 1, which corresponds to the words: `["b", "c", "d", "f"]`. The selection excludes "a" and "e" as they are at indices 0 and 4, respectively.
- **Step 4:** The resulting set of selected words is `{"b", "c", "d", "f"}`.
- **Step 5:** Compare the result with the expected set `{"b", "c", "d", "f"}` using `issame`.
- **Step 6:** Since the sets match exactly, `issame` returns `true`.

**Final Output:**
true
