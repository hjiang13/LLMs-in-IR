### LLM Simulation for `greatest_common_divisor(3, 7)`

- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `greatest_common_divisor(3, 7)`.
- Step 2: The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers can be calculated using the Euclidean algorithm. The algorithm works as follows:
  - If \( b = 0 \), then \( \text{gcd}(a, b) = a \).
  - Otherwise, compute \( \text{gcd}(b, a \mod b) \).

Using the values 3 and 7, we proceed with the simulation:
- Start with \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 7 \).
- Since \( b \neq 0 \), compute \( 3 \mod 7 \), which is \( 3 \).
- Now, we need to compute \( \text{gcd}(7, 3) \).

- Now we have \( a = 7 \) and \( b = 3 \).
- Again, since \( b \neq 0 \), compute \( 7 \mod 3 \), which is \( 1 \).
- Now, we need to compute \( \text{gcd}(3, 1) \).

- Now we have \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 1 \).
- Since \( b \neq 0 \), compute \( 3 \mod 1 \), which is \( 0 \).
- Now, we compute \( \text{gcd}(1, 0) \).

- Finally, we have \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 0 \).
- Since \( b = 0 \), we return \( a \), which is \( 1 \).

- Step 3: The result of `greatest_common_divisor(3, 7)` is \( 1 \).
- Step 4: Compare the result with the expected value \( 1 \) in the assert statement.

Since both sides of the assertion match, the function call evaluates to `true`.

**Final Output:**
true

### LLM Simulation of greatest_common_divisor

**Function Call:**
assert (greatest_common_divisor(10, 15) == 5);

**Expected Result:**
true

**LLM Simulation:**
- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `greatest_common_divisor(10, 15)`.
- Step 2: The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers can be computed using the Euclidean algorithm. This algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number by its remainder when divided by the smaller number until one of the numbers becomes zero.
  
  - Start with `a = 10` and `b = 15`.
  - Since `b` (15) is greater than `a` (10), we compute `b % a`: 
    - `15 % 10 = 5`
  - Now we replace `b` with `a` and `a` with `b % a`, so `a = 10` and `b = 5`.
  - Next, we compute `b % a`: 
    - `10 % 5 = 0`
  - Now we replace `b` with `a` and `a` with `b % a`, so `a = 5` and `b = 0`.
  - Since `b` is now 0, the GCD is the non-zero value, which is `5`.

- Step 3: The calculated GCD is `5`, which matches the expected value in the assert statement.

**Final Output:**
true

### LLM Simulation:
- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `greatest_common_divisor(49, 14)`.
- Step 2: The function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 49 and 14. It can use the Euclidean algorithm, which involves the following steps:
  1. Divide 49 by 14, which gives a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 7 (since \(49 = 14 \times 3 + 7\)).
  2. Now calculate the GCD of 14 and the remainder 7.
  3. Divide 14 by 7, which gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 0 (since \(14 = 7 \times 2 + 0\)).
  4. Since the remainder is now 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 7.
- Step 3: The result from the function is 7.
- Step 4: Compare the result with the expected value 7 using the assert statement.

**Final Output:**
true

### LLM Simulation for `greatest_common_divisor`

**Function Call:**
assert (greatest_common_divisor(144, 60) == 12);

**Expected Result:**
true

**LLM Simulation:**
- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `greatest_common_divisor(144, 60)`.
- Step 2: To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm:
  - Calculate `144 % 60` which equals `24`.
  - Now, calculate `60 % 24` which equals `12`.
  - Next, calculate `24 % 12` which equals `0`.
  - Since we reached a remainder of `0`, the last non-zero remainder is the GCD, which is `12`.
- Step 3: The result of the function is `12`.
- Step 4: Compare the result `12` with the expected result `12` in the assert statement.
- Step 5: The values match, so the assertion is valid.

**Final Output:**
true
