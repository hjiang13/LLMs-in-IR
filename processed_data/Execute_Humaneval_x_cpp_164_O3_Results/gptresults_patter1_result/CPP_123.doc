**LLM Simulation:**
- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `get_odd_collatz(14)`.
- Step 2: The Collatz sequence for 14 is generated as follows:
  - Start with 14 (even), divide by 2 → 7 (odd)
  - From 7 (odd), apply the odd rule: 3 * 7 + 1 → 22 (even)
  - From 22 (even), divide by 2 → 11 (odd)
  - From 11 (odd), apply the odd rule: 3 * 11 + 1 → 34 (even)
  - From 34 (even), divide by 2 → 17 (odd)
  - From 17 (odd), apply the odd rule: 3 * 17 + 1 → 52 (even)
  - Continue this until reaching 1, but we are only interested in the odd numbers generated.
- Step 3: Collect the odd numbers encountered during the sequence: {1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17}.
- Step 4: Compare the result with the set `{1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17}` using `issame`.
- Step 5: The sets match, so `issame` returns `true`.

**Final Output:**
true

### LLM Simulation for `get_odd_collatz(5)`

**Function Call:**
assert (issame(get_odd_collatz(5), {1, 5}));

**Expected Result:**
true

**LLM Simulation:**
- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `get_odd_collatz(5)`.
- Step 2: The Collatz sequence starts with 5 (which is odd). The rules for the Collatz sequence state:
  - If the number is odd, the next number is \(3n + 1\).
  - If the number is even, the next number is \(n / 2\).

- Step 3: Starting with 5, since it's odd:
  - Calculate \(3 \times 5 + 1 = 16\).
  - Next, 16 is even, so we divide by 2: \(16 / 2 = 8\).
  - 8 is even, so divide by 2: \(8 / 2 = 4\).
  - 4 is even, so divide by 2: \(4 / 2 = 2\).
  - 2 is even, so divide by 2: \(2 / 2 = 1\).
  - Finally, we reach 1, which is the end of the sequence.

- Step 4: The sequence of odd numbers encountered during this process is [5, 1].
- Step 5: Extract the odd numbers, resulting in the set {1, 5}.

- Step 6: Compare the result {1, 5} with the expected set {1, 5} using the `issame` function.
- Step 7: The sets match, so `issame` returns `true`.

**Final Output:**
true

- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `get_odd_collatz(12)`.
- Step 2: The Collatz sequence for the number 12 is generated as follows:
  - Start with 12 (even), so divide by 2: 12 / 2 = 6
  - 6 (even), divide by 2: 6 / 2 = 3
  - 3 (odd), so multiply by 3 and add 1: 3 * 3 + 1 = 10
  - 10 (even), divide by 2: 10 / 2 = 5
  - 5 (odd), so multiply by 3 and add 1: 5 * 3 + 1 = 16
  - 16 (even), divide by 2: 16 / 2 = 8
  - 8 (even), divide by 2: 8 / 2 = 4
  - 4 (even), divide by 2: 4 / 2 = 2
  - 2 (even), divide by 2: 2 / 2 = 1
  - The sequence ends when we reach 1.

- Step 3: From the generated sequence, the odd numbers are identified: {3, 5, 1}.

- Step 4: Now, check if the set of odd numbers extracted from the sequence `{3, 5, 1}` is the same as the provided set `{1, 3, 5}`.
- Step 5: The sets `{3, 5, 1}` and `{1, 3, 5}` are indeed equal.

- Step 6: The `issame` function will return `true` since the sets match.

**Final Output:**
true

### LLM Simulation for `get_odd_collatz(1)`

**Function Call:**
`assert (issame(get_odd_collatz(1), {1}));`

**Expected Result:**
`get_odd_collatz(1)`

**LLM Simulation:**
- **Step 1:** Simulate the IR-based function `get_odd_collatz(1)`.
- **Step 2:** The Collatz sequence for an odd starting number follows these rules:
  - If the number is odd, the next number in the sequence is `3n + 1`.
  - If the number is even, the next number is `n / 2`.
- **Step 3:** Starting with `1` (which is odd):
  - Apply the rule for an odd number: `3 * 1 + 1 = 4`.
- **Step 4:** Now, we take `4` (which is even):
  - Apply the rule for an even number: `4 / 2 = 2`.
- **Step 5:** Next, take `2` (which is also even):
  - Apply the rule for an even number: `2 / 2 = 1`.
- **Step 6:** At this point, we have cycled back to `1`, so the sequence will continue indefinitely as `1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 ...`.
- **Step 7:** The function `get_odd_collatz(1)` will therefore collect the odd numbers encountered in this cycle, which is just `{1}`.

- **Step 8:** Now we need to compare the result of `get_odd_collatz(1)` with the set `{1}` using the `issame` function.
- **Step 9:** Since both sets match (both are `{1}`), `issame` returns `true`.

**Final Output:**
true
