"assert (issame(rolling_max({}),{}));",Fail,"### LLM Simulation

- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `rolling_max({})`.
- Step 2: The function `rolling_max` takes a set of numbers as input. In this case, the input is an empty set `{}`.
- Step 3: Since there are no elements in the input set, the function will return an empty set as the rolling maximum of an empty set is also empty.
- Step 4: Now, we compare the result with the second argument in the `issame` function, which is also an empty set `{}`.
- Step 5: The two sets are identical (both are empty), so `issame` returns `true`.

**Final Output:**
true"
"assert (issame(rolling_max({1, 2, 3, 4}) , {1, 2, 3, 4}));",Fail,"- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `rolling_max({1, 2, 3, 4})`.
- Step 2: The function computes the rolling maximums of the input set. In this case, since the input is a set of numbers {1, 2, 3, 4}, the rolling maximum at each position would be as follows:
  - At position 1: maximum is 1
  - At position 2: maximum is 2
  - At position 3: maximum is 3
  - At position 4: maximum is 4
- Step 3: Therefore, the output of `rolling_max({1, 2, 3, 4})` would be `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.
- Step 4: Compare the result with the expected set `{1, 2, 3, 4}` using `issame`.
- Step 5: Since both sets match, `issame` returns `true`.

"assert (issame(rolling_max({4, 3, 2, 1}),{4, 4, 4, 4}));",Fail,"### LLM Simulation:
- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `rolling_max({4, 3, 2, 1})`.
- Step 2: Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum value seen so far as we iterate through the set.
- Step 3: Start the iteration:
  - First element: 4. Since it's the first element, the maximum is 4. The output so far is `[4]`.
  - Second element: 3. The current maximum is still 4 (since 4 > 3). The output now is `[4, 4]`.
  - Third element: 2. The current maximum remains 4 (since 4 > 2). The output now is `[4, 4, 4]`.
  - Fourth element: 1. The current maximum is still 4 (since 4 > 1). The output now is `[4, 4, 4, 4]`.
- Step 4: The final output of `rolling_max({4, 3, 2, 1})` is `{4, 4, 4, 4}`.
- Step 5: Compare the result with the expected set `{4, 4, 4, 4}` using `issame`.
- Step 6: Since both outputs are the same, `issame` returns `true`.

"assert (issame(rolling_max({3, 2, 3, 100, 3}) ,{3, 3, 3, 100, 100}));",Fail,"### LLM Simulation for the Function Call

**Function Call:**
assert (issame(rolling_max({3, 2, 3, 100, 3}), {3, 3, 3, 100, 100}));

**Expected Result:**
rolling_max({3, 2, 3, 100, 3})

**Step 1:** Simulate the IR-based function `rolling_max({3, 2, 3, 100, 3})`.

**Step 2:** The `rolling_max` function computes the maximum value encountered so far in the provided set, which is processed in the order of elements. Let's break it down:

1. Start with an empty result list.
2. Initialize `current_max` to a very small number (or the first element).
3. Iterate over each element in the input set `{3, 2, 3, 100, 3}`:
   - For the first element `3`: 
     - `current_max` is updated to `3` (max is `3`).
     - Result: `[3]`
   - For the second element `2`:
     - `current_max` remains `3` (max is still `3`).
     - Result: `[3, 3]`
   - For the third element `3`:
     - `current_max` remains `3` (max is still `3`).
     - Result: `[3, 3, 3]`
   - For the fourth element `100`:
     - `current_max` is updated to `100` (max is now `100`).
     - Result: `[3, 3, 3, 100]`
   - For the fifth element `3`:
     - `current_max` remains `100` (max is still `100`).
     - Result: `[3, 3, 3, 100, 100]`

**Step 3:** The final output of `rolling_max({3, 2, 3, 100, 3})` is `[3, 3, 3, 100, 100]`.

**Step 4:** Now, we compare the result of `rolling_max` with the expected set `{3, 3, 3, 100, 100}` using the `issame` function:
- The function `issame` checks if both sets are equivalent in terms of their elements and counts.
- Both sets are indeed the same, hence `issame` returns `true`.

**Final Output:**
true"
