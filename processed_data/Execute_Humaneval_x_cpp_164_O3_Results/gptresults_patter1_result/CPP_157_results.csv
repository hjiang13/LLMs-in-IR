"assert (right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == true);",Fail,"**LLM Simulation:**
- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5)`.
- Step 2: Check if the sides 3, 4, and 5 can form a right-angle triangle using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that for a right triangle with sides a, b, and c (where c is the longest side), the relationship \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \) must hold.
- Step 3: Identify the longest side: 5. The other two sides are 3 and 4.
- Step 4: Calculate \( 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 \) and \( 5^2 = 25 \).
- Step 5: Since \( 9 + 16 = 25 \) matches \( 5^2 = 25 \), the function confirms that these sides can form a right triangle.
- Step 6: Therefore, `right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5)` returns `true`.

"assert (right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == false);",Pass,"**LLM Simulation:**
- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3)`.
- Step 2: To determine if the sides form a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that for a right triangle with sides \(a\), \(b\), and hypotenuse \(c\), the equation \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\) must hold true.
- Step 3: First, identify the longest side, which will be treated as the hypotenuse. In this case, the sides are 1, 2, and 3, so the longest side is 3.

  - Calculate \(1^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5\).
  - Calculate \(3^2 = 9\).
- Step 5: Since \(5 \neq 9\), the sides do not satisfy the condition for forming a right triangle.

"assert (right_angle_triangle(2, 2, 2) == false);",Pass,"- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `right_angle_triangle(2, 2, 2)`.
- Step 2: The function checks if the given sides (2, 2, and 2) can form a right-angled triangle. For a triangle to be right-angled, the square of the length of the longest side must equal the sum of the squares of the other two sides (Pythagorean theorem).
- Step 3: In this case, since all sides are equal (2, 2, 2), we can identify that the longest side is 2. We calculate the squares:
  - Longest side squared: \(2^2 = 4\)
  - Sum of the squares of the other two sides: \(2^2 + 2^2 = 4 + 4 = 8\)
- Step 4: Compare the longest side squared (4) with the sum of the squares of the other two sides (8). Since \(4 \neq 8\), the sides do not satisfy the condition for being a right-angled triangle.
- Step 5: The function `right_angle_triangle(2, 2, 2)` returns `false`.
