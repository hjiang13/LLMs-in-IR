### LLM Simulation for `sum_squares`

**Function Call:**
assert (sum_squares({1,2,3}) == 6);

**Expected Result:**
sum_squares({1,2,3})

**LLM Simulation:**
- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `sum_squares({1, 2, 3})`.
- Step 2: Calculate the sum of the squares of each element in the set:
  - For 1: \(1^2 = 1\)
  - For 2: \(2^2 = 4\)
  - For 3: \(3^2 = 9\)
- Step 3: Add these squared values together: \(1 + 4 + 9 = 14\).
- Step 4: The calculated result is 14, which does not match the expected value of 6.
- Step 5: Since the result does not equal 6, the assert statement fails.

**Final Output:**
false

**LLM Simulation:**
- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `sum_squares({1, 4, 9})`.
- Step 2: Calculate the sum of the squares of the elements in the set:
  - The squares of the elements are:
    - \(1^2 = 1\)
    - \(4^2 = 16\)
    - \(9^2 = 81\)
- Step 3: Now, sum these squared values:
  - \(1 + 16 + 81 = 98\).
- Step 4: The result of `sum_squares({1, 4, 9})` is 98, which does not equal 14.
- Step 5: Since the result does not match the expected value, the assertion fails.

**Final Output:**
false

### LLM Simulation for `sum_squares({})`

**Function Call:**
assert (sum_squares({}) == 0);

**Expected Result:**
true

**LLM Simulation:**
- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `sum_squares({})`.
- Step 2: The input is an empty set `{}`. 
- Step 3: Since there are no elements in the set, the function calculates the sum of the squares of the elements, which results in `0`.
- Step 4: The result `0` matches the expected result from the assert statement.

**Final Output:**
true

### Task Simulation
**Function Call:**
assert (sum_squares({1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1}) == 9);

**Expected Result:**
sum_squares({1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1})

**LLM Simulation:**
- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `sum_squares({1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1})`.
- Step 2: The input set `{1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1}` simplifies to `{1}` since sets do not contain duplicates.
- Step 3: The function `sum_squares` calculates the sum of the squares of the elements in the set. For the set `{1}`, the calculation is: 
  - \(1^2 = 1\)
- Step 4: Since there is only one element in the set, the final result is simply \(1\).
- Step 5: Compare the result with the expected value `9`. Since \(1 \neq 9\), the assertion fails.

**Final Output:**
false

Failed to parse the assert statement

**LLM Simulation:**
- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `sum_squares({0})`.
- Step 2: The function calculates the sum of squares of the elements in the set `{0}`. In this case, it computes \(0^2 = 0\).
- Step 3: The result of the sum of squares is `0`.
- Step 4: The expected result in the assert statement is `0`, and since the calculated result matches the expected result, the function returns `true`.

**Final Output:**
true

**LLM Simulation:**
- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `sum_squares({-56,-99,1,0,-2})`.
- Step 2: Calculate the square of each element in the set:
  - (-56)² = 3136
  - (-99)² = 9801
  - 1² = 1
  - 0² = 0
  - (-2)² = 4
- Step 3: Sum the squared values: 3136 + 9801 + 1 + 0 + 4 = 12942.
- Step 4: Compare the result with the expected value of 3030. Since 12942 does not equal 3030, the assertion is false.

**Final Output:**
false

- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `sum_squares({-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1})`.
- Step 2: Calculate the sum of the squares of each element in the set:
  - The elements are `-1` and `0`.
  - The square of `-1` is `1`.
  - The square of `0` is `0`.
- Step 3: Since the set contains `-1` twice and `0` multiple times, we compute:
  - Sum = `1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 2`.
- Step 4: The expected result of the function should be `2`, but the assertion checks if it equals `0`. Therefore, the assertion fails.

**Final Output:**
false
