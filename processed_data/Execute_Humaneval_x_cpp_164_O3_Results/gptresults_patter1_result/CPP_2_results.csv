assert (truncate_number(3.5) == 0.5);,Fail,"- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `truncate_number(3.5)`.
- Step 2: The function truncates the number `3.5` to its integer part, which is `3`.
- Step 3: The function then calculates the fractional part by subtracting the truncated integer from the original number: `3.5 - 3 = 0.5`.
- Step 4: The result is `0.5`, which matches the expected value in the assert statement.

**Final Output:**
true"
