"assert (add(0, 1) == 1);",Fail,"- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `add(0, 1)`.
- Step 2: The function performs the addition operation: 0 + 1 = 1.
- Step 3: The result of the addition is 1, which matches the expected result in the assert statement.
- Step 4: Since the calculated result equals the expected result, the assertion is true.

**Final Output:**

"assert (add(1, 0) == 1);",Fail,"- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `add(1, 0)`.
- Step 2: The function takes two arguments: `1` and `0`.
- Step 3: The function performs the addition operation: \(1 + 0 = 1\).
- Step 4: The result is `1`, which matches the expected result in the assert statement.

**Final Output:**

"assert (add(2, 3) == 5);",Fail,"- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `add(2, 3)`.
- Step 2: The function performs the operation: 2 + 3 = 5.
- Step 3: The result of the addition is 5, which matches the expected value in the assert statement.
- Step 4: Since the result is equal to the expected value, the assert statement evaluates to true.

**Final Output:**

"assert (add(5, 7) == 12);",Fail,"- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `add(5, 7)`.
- Step 2: The function performs the addition operation: 5 + 7 = 12.
- Step 3: The result of the addition is 12, which matches the expected result in the assert statement.

**Final Output:**
true"
"assert (add(7, 5) == 12);",Fail,"- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `add(7, 5)`.
- Step 2: The function takes two integers, 7 and 5, and performs the addition operation: 7 + 5.
- Step 3: Calculate the result: 7 + 5 = 12.
- Step 4: The result of the addition is 12, which matches the expected result in the assert statement.

**Final Output:**
