"assert (issame(remove_duplicates({}) , {}));",Fail,"**LLM Simulation:**

- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `remove_duplicates({})`.
- Step 2: The input set is empty, meaning there are no elements to check for duplicates.
- Step 3: Since there are no elements in the set, the function would return an empty set as well.
- Step 4: Now, compare the result of `remove_duplicates({})`, which is `{}`, with the expected output `{}` using the `issame` function.
- Step 5: The sets match because both are empty sets, so `issame` returns `true`.

**Final Output:**
true"
"assert (issame(remove_duplicates({1, 2, 3, 4}) , {1, 2, 3, 4}));",Fail,"- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `remove_duplicates({1, 2, 3, 4})`.
- Step 2: The function processes the input set `{1, 2, 3, 4}`. Since sets inherently do not allow duplicates, the function will check for any repeated elements.
- Step 3: As there are no duplicates in the set `{1, 2, 3, 4}`, the function returns the same set `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.
- Step 4: Compare the result with `{1, 2, 3, 4}` using `issame`.

"assert (issame(remove_duplicates({1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5}) , {1, 4, 5}));",Pass,"**LLM Simulation:**

- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `remove_duplicates({1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5})`.
- Step 2: The function processes the input set `{1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5}`. Since sets inherently do not allow duplicate values, the duplicates (the second occurrences of `2` and `3`) are removed.
- Step 3: After processing, the result is `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`.
- Step 4: Now we need to compare the result `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}` with the expected set `{1, 4, 5}` using the `issame` function.
- Step 5: The two sets `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}` and `{1, 4, 5}` are not the same since `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}` contains additional elements `2` and `3` that are not in `{1, 4, 5}`.
- Step 6: Since the sets do not match, the `issame` function will return `false`.

**Final Output:**
false"
