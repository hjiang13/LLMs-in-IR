### LLM Simulation for `is_simple_power(1, 4)`

- **Step 1:** Simulate the IR-based function `is_simple_power(1, 4)`.
- **Step 2:** The function checks if the first argument (1) can be expressed as a power of the second argument (4). In mathematical terms, this means checking if there exists a non-negative integer `n` such that \( 4^n = 1 \).
- **Step 3:** The only power of 4 that equals 1 is when \( n = 0 \) (since \( 4^0 = 1 \)). Thus, \( 1 \) is indeed a simple power of \( 4 \).
- **Step 4:** The function returns `true` since \( 1 \) can be represented as \( 4^0 \).

**Final Output:**
true

- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `is_simple_power(2, 2)`.

### LLM Simulation for `is_simple_power`

**Function Call:**
assert (is_simple_power(3, 2) == false);

**Expected Result:**
is_simple_power(3, 2)

**LLM Simulation Steps:**

- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `is_simple_power(3, 2)`.
- Step 2: The function checks if there exists an integer `k` such that \( 2^k = 3 \).
- Step 3: Start with `k = 0`, calculate \( 2^0 = 1 \). This is less than 3, so we increment `k`.
- Step 4: For `k = 1`, calculate \( 2^1 = 2 \). This is still less than 3, so we increment `k`.
- Step 5: For `k = 2`, calculate \( 2^2 = 4 \). This exceeds 3.
- Step 6: Since no integer `k` satisfies \( 2^k = 3 \), the function concludes that 3 is not a simple power of 2.
- Step 7: The function returns `false`.

**Final Output:**
false

### Task
**Function Call:**
assert (is_simple_power(3, 1) == false);

**Expected Result:**
is_simple_power(3, 1)

**LLM Simulation:**
- Step 1: Simulate the IR-based function `is_simple_power(3, 1)`.
- Step 2: The function checks if the number 3 can be expressed as \( n^k \) for integers \( n \) and \( k \) where \( k \) is greater than 1. 
- Step 3: Since \( k = 1 \) in this case, any number can be expressed as itself raised to the first power (e.g., \( 3^1 = 3 \)). 
- Step 4: Therefore, `is_simple_power(3, 1)` does not satisfy the condition of being a "simple power" in the context where \( k \) must be greater than 1.
- Step 5: As a result, the function returns `false`.

**Final Output:**
false

assert (is_simple_power(5, 3) == false);

**Expected Result:**
false

- Step 3: Calculate powers of integers starting from 1 upwards to find if there exists an integer \( n \) such that \( n^3 = 5 \).
- Step 4: The cube root of 5 is approximately 1.71, which is not an integer. The integer values of \( n \) (1 and 2) yield \( 1^3 = 1 \) and \( 2^3 = 8 \), neither of which equals 5.
- Step 5: Since there is no integer \( n \) where \( n^3 = 5 \), the function returns `false`.

**Final Output:**
