To execute the provided IR code step by step and verify the output against the assert statement `assert(issame(tri(1), {1, 3}));`, we first need to understand the function `tri` and how it processes its argument.

### Step-by-Step Execution of the IR Code

#### Step 1: Function Definition
The function being analyzed is `tri`, which takes a parameter `%1` of type `i32`. 

#### Step 2: Memory Allocation
1. The function begins with the allocation of memory for 2 integers using `@_Znwm(i64 8)`, which allocates space for 2 integers (4 bytes each).
2. The memory allocated is then cast to an `i32*` (pointer to integer) and stored in `%4`.

#### Step 3: Initial Values Setup
1. The values `1` and `3` are stored in the allocated memory:
   - `store i32 1, i32* %4, align 4` (stores `1` in the first integer)
   - `store i32 3, i32* %8, align 4` (stores `3` in the second integer where `%8` is calculated as an offset).

#### Step 4: Conditional Logic
1. The function checks the value of `%1` (the input argument).
2. If `%1` equals `0`, it initializes a vector with the allocated values (which would be empty if not handled).
3. If `%1` is less than `2`, it adds `1` to the return value (not applicable here since we are passing `1`).

#### Step 5: Return Values
1. The function eventually prepares to return the values. 
2. The values stored in the allocated memory (`1` and `3`) are returned as a vector type indicated by the return type `%0`.

### Step 6: Verify Against Assert Statement
The output of the function `tri(1)` should yield the vector `{1, 3}` based on the values we stored.

### Final Output
The output we expect from calling `tri(1)` is indeed `{1, 3}`.

### Verification of the Result
We check if the output generated by the execution of the IR code matches the expected output in the assert statement:
```cpp
assert(issame(tri(1), {1, 3}));
```
- Since the function was designed to return exactly `{1, 3}` when called with `1`, the assertion holds true.

### Conclusion
- The execution of the IR code has been clearly reasoned through each step.
- The final output matches the expected outcome.
- The verification confirms that the result is correct.
