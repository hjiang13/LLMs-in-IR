Assert Statement: assert (issame(rolling_max({}),{}));
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of this C++ code snippet, focusing on how it calculates the rolling maximum of a vector.

**Understanding the Code**

The provided IR code implements a function named `rolling_max`. This function takes two vectors as input:

* `%1`: The input vector containing a sequence of numbers.
* `%0`: An empty vector that will store the rolling maximum values.

The function's goal is to iterate through the input vector (`%1`) and calculate the maximum value encountered so far at each position. These maximum values are then stored in the output vector (`%0`).

**Step-by-Step Execution**

1. **Initialization:**

   * The code starts by initializing the output vector (`%0`) with zeros. This sets up the storage for the rolling maximum values.

2. **Iteration:**

   * The core of the function lies in a loop that iterates through the elements of the input vector (`%1`).

3. **Comparison and Update:**

   * Inside the loop, the code compares the current element of the input vector with the current maximum value. If the current element is larger, the maximum value is updated.

4. **Storage:**

   * After processing each element, the current maximum value is stored in the corresponding position of the output vector (`%0`).

5. **Return:**

   * Once all elements of the input vector have been processed, the function returns the output vector (`%0`) containing the rolling maximum values.

**Illustrative Example**

Let's assume the input vector is `{1, 5, 2, 4, 3}`. The `rolling_max` function would produce the following output:

* `{1, 5, 5, 5, 5}`

**Explanation:**

* The first element (1) is the initial maximum.
* The second element (5) is larger than the previous maximum (1), so the maximum becomes 5.
* The third element (2) is smaller than the current maximum (5), so the maximum remains 5.
* The fourth element (4) is smaller than the current maximum (5), so the maximum remains 5.
* The fifth element (3) is smaller than the current maximum (5), so the maximum remains 5.

**Verification**

The provided assertion `assert (issame(rolling_max({}),{}));` tests whether the `rolling_max` function correctly handles an empty input vector. In this case, the output should also be an empty vector, which satisfies the assertion.

Assert Statement: assert (issame(rolling_max({1, 2, 3, 4}) , {1, 2, 3, 4}));
Execution Result:
```
Step 1: Function Entry
The code starts by defining the `rolling_max` function, which takes two arguments:

* `%0`: A pointer to the output vector (of type `std::vector<int>`).
* `%1`: A pointer to the input vector (also of type `std::vector<int>`).

Step 2: Initialization
The function first initializes the output vector `%0` by setting its size to 0.

Step 3: Input Vector Check
It then checks if the input vector `%1` is empty. If it is, the function simply returns.

Step 4: Iteration
If the input vector is not empty, the function iterates over its elements.

Step 5: Maximum Value Tracking
For each element in the input vector, the function compares it with the current maximum value.

If the current element is greater than the maximum value, the maximum value is updated.

Step 6: Storing the Maximums
The function stores the maximum value encountered so far into the output vector.

Step 7: Return
After processing all elements in the input vector, the function returns the output vector containing the rolling maximums.

Applying this to the input ` {1, 2, 3, 4}`

* The rolling maximums would be: `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.

Therefore, the assertion `issame(rolling_max({1, 2, 3, 4}) , {1, 2, 3, 4})` holds true.

Final Output:


```
{1, 2, 3, 4}
```

Assert Statement: assert (issame(rolling_max({4, 3, 2, 1}),{4, 4, 4, 4}));
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of the provided IR code step by step.

**Understanding the Code**

The IR code implements a function called `rolling_max` which takes a vector of integers as input and returns a new vector containing the rolling maximum of the input vector. The rolling maximum at each position is the maximum element seen so far.

**Step 1: Initialization**

*   The function starts by zeroing out the memory allocated for the output vector.

*   It then obtains pointers to the beginning and end of the input vector.

**Step 2: Iteration**

*   The code iterates through the input vector using a loop.

*   In each iteration, it compares the current element with the current maximum (`max`).

*   If the current element is greater than `max`, it updates `max` to the current element.

*   The updated `max` is then appended to the output vector.

**Step 3: Return**

*   Once the loop completes, the function returns the output vector containing the rolling maximums.

**Applying the Input**

For the input vector `{4, 3, 2, 1}`, the function would execute as follows:

1.  **Initialization:** `max` is initialized to the first element, which is 4.
2.  **Iteration 1:**
    *   Current element: 3
    *   `max` remains 4 (since 4 is greater than 3)
    *   Output vector: `{4}`
3.  **Iteration 2:**
    *   Current element: 2
    *   `max` remains 4
    *   Output vector: `{4, 4}`
4.  **Iteration 3:**
    *   Current element: 1
    *   `max` remains 4
    *   Output vector: `{4, 4, 4}`

**Final Output:**

The function returns the vector `{4, 4, 4, 4}`, which is the rolling maximum of the input vector `{4, 3, 2, 1}`.

**Verification:**

The output `{4, 4, 4, 4}` matches the expected result, confirming the correctness of the code's execution.

**Conclusion:**

The IR code effectively implements the rolling maximum function. It iterates through the input vector, maintains the current maximum, and appends it to the output vector for each element. The final output is the rolling maximum of the input vector.

Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of the provided IR code step-by-step.

**Understanding the Code**

The IR code you've provided implements a function named `rolling_max`. This function takes a vector of integers as input and returns a new vector where each element is the maximum value seen up to that point in the input vector.

**Step-by-Step Execution**

1. **Initialization:**
   - The function starts by initializing an empty vector `%0` (the output vector) with a size of 0.

2. **Input Vector:**
   - The input vector `%1` is passed to the function. We'll assume for this example that `%1` contains the values `{3, 2, 3, 100, 3}`.

3. **Iteration:**
   - The code then enters a loop that iterates through each element of the input vector `%1`.

4. **Comparison and Update:**
   - In each iteration, the current element of `%1` is compared with the current maximum value stored in the output vector `%0`.
   - If the current element is greater than the current maximum, it becomes the new maximum, and is appended to the output vector `%0`.
   - Otherwise, the current maximum is appended to the output vector.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements in the input vector, the function returns the output vector `%0`, which now contains the rolling maximum values.

**Detailed Breakdown of Key Instructions:**

- `%4 = getelementptr inbounds %"class.std::vector", %"class.std::vector"* %1, i64 0, i32 0, i32 0, i32 0, i32 1`: This instruction calculates the address of the end of the input vector `%1`.

- `%14 = phi i32* [ %67, %66 ], [ %10, %2 ]`: This instruction uses the phi function to track the current element being processed in the input vector.

- `%21 = getelementptr inbounds i32, i32* %14, i64 %19`: This instruction calculates the address of the current element being processed in the input vector.

- `%22 = load i32, i32* %21, align 4, !tbaa !9`: This instruction loads the value of the current element from memory.

- `%23 = icmp sgt i32 %22, %20`: This instruction compares the current element with the current maximum value.

- `%24 = select i1 %23, i32 %22, i32 %20`: This instruction selects the larger value between the current element and the current maximum.

- `store i32 %24, i32* %18, align 4, !tbaa !9`: This instruction stores the selected maximum value into the output vector.

**Verification**

Given the input vector `{3, 2, 3, 100, 3}`, the expected output is `{3, 3, 3, 100, 100}`.

The provided IR code correctly implements the rolling maximum algorithm and should produce the expected output.
