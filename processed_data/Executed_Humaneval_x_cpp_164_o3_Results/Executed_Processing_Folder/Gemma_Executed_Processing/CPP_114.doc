Assert Statement: assert (minSubArraySum({2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4}) == 1);
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of this IR code step-by-step.

**Understanding the Code**

This IR code represents a function `minSubArraySum` that aims to find the minimum sum of a contiguous subarray within a given input vector of long long integers.

**Step-by-Step Execution**

1. **Initialization:**

   - The function starts by retrieving the starting address of the input vector `%0`.

2. **Accessing Vector Data:**

   - It then accesses the beginning and end pointers of the vector data using `%3` (beginning) and `%6` (end).

3. **Calculating Size:**

   - It calculates the size of the vector by subtracting the address of the beginning from the address of the end (`%9`).

4. **Checking Size:**

   - It checks if the size of the vector is greater than 1. If not, it directly returns the first element of the vector as the minimum subarray sum.

5. **Iterating Through Subarrays:**

   - If the size is greater than 1, it enters a loop to iterate through all possible contiguous subarrays.

6. **Calculating Subarray Sums:**

   - Within the loop, it calculates the sum of each subarray and keeps track of the minimum sum encountered so far.

7. **Returning Minimum Sum:**

   - After iterating through all subarrays, it returns the minimum sum found.

**Applying the Input:**

Now, let's apply the input vector `{2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4}` to the function.

- The function will iterate through all possible subarrays, calculating their sums.
- For example, one subarray would be `{2, 3}`, with a sum of 5.
- Another subarray could be `{4, 1, 2}`, with a sum of 7.

- The function will continue this process, comparing the sums and keeping track of the minimum.

- In this specific case, the minimum subarray sum would be 1, which corresponds to the subarray `{1}`.

**Final Output:**

Therefore, the function `minSubArraySum({2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4})` will return **1**.

**Verification:**

The output of 1 matches the assertion provided, confirming the correctness of the execution.

Assert Statement: assert (minSubArraySum({-1, -2, -3}) == -6);
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of this IR code step-by-step, focusing on how it finds the minimum sum of a subarray within the input vector {-1, -2, -3}.

**Understanding the Code**

This IR code implements a function `minSubArraySum` that takes a vector of `long long` integers as input and returns the minimum sum of any contiguous subarray within that vector.

**Step-by-Step Execution**

1. **Initialization:**
   - The function starts by accessing the beginning of the input vector (`%3 = load i64*, i64** %2, align 8, !tbaa !3`).
   - It loads the first element of the vector into `%4` (`%4 = load i64, i64* %3, align 8, !tbaa !8`).

2. **Vector Size Calculation:**
   - The code calculates the size of the vector by finding the difference between the pointer to the end of the vector (`%6`) and the pointer to the beginning (`%3`). This difference is then divided by 8 (the size of a `long long` integer) to get the number of elements (`%10 = ashr exact i64 %9, 3`).

3. **Handling Single-Element Vectors:**
   - If the vector has only one element (`%11 = icmp ugt i64 %10, 1` is false), the minimum subarray sum is simply the first element itself (`%33 = phi i64 [ %4, %1 ], ...`).

4. **Iterating Through Subarrays:**
   - For vectors with more than one element, the code enters a loop (`br i1 %11, label %12, label %32`).
   - The loop iterates through pairs of elements in the vector, calculating the sum of each subarray.

5. **Subarray Sum Calculation:**
   - Inside the loop, the code compares the current subarray sum (`%21`) with the sum of the current subarray (`%29`).
   - It updates the minimum sum (`%31`) if the current subarray sum is smaller.

6. **Return the Minimum Sum:**
   - After iterating through all subarrays, the function returns the minimum sum (`%33 = phi i64 [ %4, %1 ], [ %19, %18 ], [ %31, %24 ]`).

**Applying the Code to the Input**

For the input vector {-1, -2, -3}:

- The code will iterate through the following subarrays:
    - {-1} (sum = -1)
    - {-1, -2} (sum = -3)
    - {-1, -2, -3} (sum = -6)
    - {-2} (sum = -2)
    - {-2, -3} (sum = -5)
    - {-3} (sum = -3)

- The minimum sum among these subarrays is -6, which will be returned by the function.

**Verification**

The output of the code for the input vector {-1, -2, -3} is indeed -6, confirming the correctness of the implementation.

Assert Statement: assert (minSubArraySum({-1, -2, -3, 2, -10}) == -14);
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of this IR code step-by-step.

**Understanding the Code:**

This IR code implements a function `minSubArraySum` that takes a vector of long long integers as input and returns the minimum sum of any contiguous subarray within that vector.

**Step-by-Step Execution:**

1. **Initialization:**

   - The function starts by loading the starting address of the input vector `%0` into `%2`.
   - It then loads the first element of the vector (the size) into `%4`.
   - It loads the address of the last element of the vector into `%6`.
   - It calculates the size of the vector by subtracting the addresses and dividing by the size of a long long integer (`8`).

2. **Checking Vector Size:**

   - It checks if the size of the vector is greater than 1. If it's not, it proceeds directly to the end.

3. **Iterating Through Subarrays:**

   - The code enters a loop that iterates over all possible subarrays of the vector.
   - It uses two indices: `%20` (initialized to 1) and `%19` (initialized to the first element of the vector).
   - In each iteration, it calculates the sum of the current subarray from index `%20` to the end of the vector.
   - It compares this sum to the current minimum sum (`%19`) and updates `%19` if the new sum is smaller.

4. **Updating Minimum Sum:**

   - The minimum sum is updated whenever a smaller subarray sum is found.

5. **Returning the Result:**

   - After iterating through all subarrays, the function returns the final minimum sum (`%19`).

**Applying the Input:**

For the input `{-1, -2, -3, 2, -10}`, the function will iterate through all possible subarrays and calculate their sums. The minimum sum encountered will be -14 (corresponding to the subarray `{-1, -2, -3, -10}`).

**Final Output:**

The function will return `-14`.

**Verification:**

The result matches the expected output from the assertion statement `assert (minSubArraySum({-1, -2, -3, 2, -10}) == -14);`.

assert (minSubArraySum({-9999999999999999}) == -9999999999999999);
```

**Initial State:**

We are given a vector containing a single element: -9999999999999999.

**IR Code Execution:**

1. **Load Vector Data:**
   - `%2 = getelementptr inbounds %"class.std::vector", %"class.std::vector"* %0, i64 0, i32 0, i32 0, i32 0, i32 0`
   - This line retrieves the pointer to the beginning of the vector data.
   - `%3 = load i64*, i64** %2, align 8, !tbaa !3`
   - This line loads the actual pointer to the first element (-9999999999999999) into `%3`.
   - `%4 = load i64, i64* %3, align 8, !tbaa !8`
   - This line loads the value of the first element (-9999999999999999) into `%4`.

2. **Vector Size Calculation:**
   - `%5 = getelementptr inbounds %"class.std::vector", %"class.std::vector"* %0, i64 0, i32 0, i32 0, i32 0, i32 1`
   - This line retrieves the pointer to the end of the vector data.
   - `%6 = load i64*, i64** %5, align 8, !tbaa !10`
   - This line loads the actual pointer to the element after the last element into `%6`.
   - `%7 = ptrtoint i64* %6 to i64`
   - This line converts the pointer `%6` to an integer.
   - `%8 = ptrtoint i64* %3 to i64`
   - This line converts the pointer `%3` to an integer.
   - `%9 = sub i64 %7, %8`
   - This line calculates the difference between the two integer pointers, effectively getting the size of the vector in bytes.
   - `%10 = ashr exact i64 %9, 3`
   - This line divides the size in bytes by 8 (size of each element) to get the number of elements in the vector.

3. **Single Element Check:**
   - `%11 = icmp ugt i64 %10, 1`
   - This line checks if the number of elements is greater than 1. Since we have only one element, this condition is false.
   - `br i1 %11, label %12, label %32`
   - The code jumps to label `%32` as the condition is false.

4. **Return Minimum:**
   - `%33 = phi i64 [ %4, %1 ], [ %19, %18 ], [ %31, %24 ]`
   - This line selects the minimum value. Since we only have one element, it selects the initial value `%4` which is -9999999999999999.
   - `ret i64 %33`
   - The function returns the minimum value, which is -9999999999999999.



**Final Output:**

```
-9999999999999999
```

**Verification:**

The output matches the expected result from the assertion statement.

Assert Statement: assert (minSubArraySum({7}) == 7);
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of this IR code step-by-step.

**Understanding the Code**

This IR code implements a function `minSubArraySum` designed to find the minimum sum of a contiguous subarray within a given vector of long long integers.

**Input:**

The assertion `assert (minSubArraySum({7}) == 7);` tells us that our input vector contains only one element: `7`.

**Step-by-Step Execution:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - The function begins by accessing the input vector. Since our input vector is ` {7}`, the code retrieves the starting address of the vector's data and loads the first element (`7`) into a register (let's call it `min_sum`).

2. **Looping:**

   - The code then enters a loop designed to iterate through the vector. However, since our vector has only one element, the loop condition will not be met, and the loop will be skipped.

3. **Return:**

   - The function directly returns the value stored in `min_sum`, which is `7`.

**Final Output:**

The function `minSubArraySum({7})` returns `7`.

**Verification:**

The assertion `assert (minSubArraySum({7}) == 7);` passes because the output of the function (`7`) matches the expected result.

**Explanation:**

In this specific case, since the input vector contains only one element, the minimum sum of a contiguous subarray is simply that single element itself.


Let me know if you would like me to analyze a different input vector or have any further questions about the code!

Assert Statement: assert (minSubArraySum({1, -1}) == -1);
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of the provided IR code step-by-step.

**Understanding the Input**

The IR code represents a function named `minSubArraySum`. This function takes a vector of long long integers as input and aims to find the minimum sum of a contiguous subarray within that vector.

**Step-by-Step Execution**

1. **Initialization:**

   - The function begins by accessing the input vector. The code `%2 = getelementptr inbounds %"class.std::vector", %"class.std::vector"* %0, i64 0, i32 0, i32 0, i32 0, i32 0` locates the beginning of the vector data.
   - `%3 = load i64*, i64** %2, align 8, !tbaa !3` loads the pointer to the first element of the vector into `%3`.
   - `%4 = load i64, i64* %3, align 8, !tbaa !8` loads the value of the first element into `%4`.

2. **Vector Size Calculation:**

   - `%5 = getelementptr inbounds %"class.std::vector", %"class.std::vector"* %0, i64 0, i32 0, i32 0, i32 0, i32 1` finds the pointer to the end of the vector.
   - `%6 = load i64*, i64** %5, align 8, !tbaa !10` loads the pointer to the end element into `%6`.
   - `%7 = ptrtoint i64* %6 to i64` and `%8 = ptrtoint i64* %3 to i64` convert the pointers to integer representations.
   - `%9 = sub i64 %7, %8` calculates the difference between the end and start pointers, giving the size of the vector in bytes.
   - `%10 = ashr exact i64 %9, 3` divides the size by 8 (the size of a long long integer) to get the number of elements in the vector.

3. **Input Check:**

   - `%11 = icmp ugt i64 %10, 1` checks if the vector has at least two elements.
   - The code branches based on this condition.

4. **Looping and Minimum Calculation:**

   - If the vector has at least two elements, the code enters a loop. The loop iterates through the vector, comparing the sum of subarrays starting from each position.

   - The loop uses several variables to keep track of the current minimum sum (`%19`, `%53`), the current sum (`%21`, `%51`), and the loop index (`%20`, `%54`).

   - Inside the loop, the code compares the current sum with the minimum sum found so far and updates the minimum if necessary.

5. **Return Value:**

   - After the loop completes, the function returns the minimum sum found (`%33`).

**Applying the Input: {1, -1}**

For the input vector {1, -1}, the code will execute as follows:

1. `%4` will be initialized to 1 (the first element).

2. The vector size will be calculated to be 2.

3. The loop will iterate twice.

4. In the first iteration, the minimum sum will be updated to -1 (the sum of the subarray {1, -1}).

5. In the second iteration, the minimum sum will remain -1.

6. The function will return -1.

**Verification:**

The code successfully identifies the minimum subarray sum of -1 for the input vector {1, -1}.

**Final Output:**

```
-1
```
