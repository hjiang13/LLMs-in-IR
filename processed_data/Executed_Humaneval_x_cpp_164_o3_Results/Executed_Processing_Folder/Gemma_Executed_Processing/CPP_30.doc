Assert Statement: assert (issame(get_positive({-1, -2, 4, 5, 6}) , {4, 5, 6} ));
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of this IR code step-by-step.

**Understanding the Code**

This IR code defines a function `get_positive` that takes a vector of floats as input and returns a new vector containing only the positive elements from the input.

**Step-by-Step Execution**

1. **Initialization:**
   - The function starts by initializing an empty vector `%0` to store the positive elements.

2. **Accessing Input Vector:**
   - It retrieves pointers to the beginning and end of the input vector `%1` and stores them in `%3` and `%4` respectively.

3. **Iterating Through the Input Vector:**
   - The code uses a loop (starting at label `12`) to iterate through the elements of the input vector.

4. **Checking for Positive Elements:**
   - Inside the loop, it loads each element from the input vector into `%20`.
   - It then checks if `%20` is greater than 0 using the `fcmp ogt` instruction.

5. **Adding Positive Elements to the Output Vector:**
   - If the element is positive, it's added to the output vector `%0`.
   - The code manages memory allocation for the output vector dynamically.

6. **Loop Termination:**
   - The loop continues until it reaches the end of the input vector.

7. **Returning the Output Vector:**
   - Finally, the function returns the output vector `%0` containing only the positive elements.

**Applying the Input**

Let's apply the input `{ -1, -2, 4, 5, 6 }` to the function.

1. The input vector is loaded into `%1`.
2. The loop iterates through each element: -1, -2, 4, 5, and 6.
3. Only 4, 5, and 6 are positive.
4. These positive elements are added to the output vector `%0`.
5. The function returns the output vector `%0` containing `{ 4, 5, 6 }`.

**Verification**


The output `{ 4, 5, 6 }` matches the expected result for the given input.

**Conclusion**

The IR code successfully implements a function that extracts positive elements from a vector of floats. The step-by-step execution demonstrates how the code iterates through the input, identifies positive elements, and constructs a new vector containing only those positive elements.

Assert Statement: assert (issame(get_positive({5, 3, -5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10}) , {5, 3, 2, 3, 3, 9, 123, 1}));
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of this IR code step-by-step. 

**Understanding the Code**

The provided IR code defines a function `get_positive` that takes a vector of floats as input and returns a new vector containing only the positive elements from the input.

**Step-by-Step Execution**

1. **Initialization:**

   - The function starts by initializing an empty vector `%0` to store the positive elements.
   - It then gets pointers to the beginning and end of the input vector `%1`.

2. **Iteration:**
   - The code enters a loop that iterates through each element of the input vector.

3. **Checking for Positive Elements:**
   - Inside the loop, it retrieves the current element and checks if it's greater than 0.

4. **Adding Positive Elements:**
   - If the element is positive, it's added to the end of the output vector `%0`.

5. **Loop Continuation:**
   - The loop continues until all elements of the input vector have been processed.

6. **Return:**
   - Finally, the function returns the output vector `%0` containing only the positive elements.

**Applying the Input**

Let's apply the input vector `{5, 3, -5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10}` to the `get_positive` function.

- The function will iterate through each element.
- It will add 5, 3, 2, 3, 3, 9, 123, and 1 to the output vector since they are all positive.

**Final Output**

The function will return the following vector: `{5, 3, 2, 3, 3, 9, 123, 1}`.

**Verification**

The output vector matches the expected result provided in the assert statement.

Therefore, the execution of the IR code is correct and produces the expected output.

Assert Statement: assert (issame(get_positive({-1, -2}) , {} ));
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of this IR code step-by-step.

**Understanding the Code**

This IR code implements a function `get_positive` that takes a vector of floats as input and returns a new vector containing only the positive elements from the input vector.

**Step-by-Step Execution**

1. **Initialization:**

   - The function starts by allocating memory for the output vector. 
   - It initializes the output vector's size and capacity to zero.

2. **Iteration:**

   - The code iterates through each element of the input vector.

3. **Positive Check:**

   - For each element, it checks if the element is greater than zero.

4. **Append to Output:**

   - If the element is positive, it is appended to the output vector.

5. **Return:**

   - After processing all elements, the function returns the output vector containing only the positive elements.

**Applying the Assertion**

The assertion `assert (issame(get_positive({-1, -2}) , {} ));` tests if the output of `get_positive` when given the input vector `{-1, -2}` is an empty vector `{}`.

**Step-by-Step Execution with the Assertion Input:**

1. **Input:** The input vector is `{-1, -2}`.

2. **Iteration:** The code iterates through each element `-1` and `-2`.

3. **Positive Check:** Both `-1` and `-2` are negative, so they fail the positive check.

4. **Append to Output:** No elements are appended to the output vector because none are positive.

5. **Return:** The function returns an empty vector `{}`.

6. **Assertion:** The assertion `issame(get_positive({-1, -2}) , {} )` passes because the output vector is indeed empty.

**Conclusion**

The IR code correctly implements the `get_positive` function. The assertion passes, confirming that the function behaves as expected when given an input vector containing only negative elements.

Assert Statement: assert (issame(get_positive({}) , {}));
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of this C++ code snippet step by step.

**Understanding the Code**

This code implements a function `get_positive` that takes a vector of floats as input and returns a new vector containing only the positive elements from the input.

**Step-by-Step Execution**

1. **Initialization:**
   - The function begins by initializing a new, empty vector `result` to store the positive elements.
   - It then retrieves pointers to the beginning and end of the input vector `input`.

2. **Iterating Through the Input Vector:**
   - The code uses a `while` loop to iterate through each element of the input vector.

3. **Checking for Positive Elements:**
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current element is greater than 0.

4. **Adding Positive Elements to the Result:**
   - If the element is positive, it is added to the end of the `result` vector.

5. **Returning the Result:**
   - After processing all elements, the function returns the `result` vector containing only the positive elements.

**Applying the Input:**

Since the input provided is an empty vector `{}`, the `while` loop will not execute. The `result` vector will remain empty.

**Final Output:**

The function will return an empty vector: `{}`

**Verification:**

The output matches the expected result for an empty input vector.
