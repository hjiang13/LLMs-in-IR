Assert Statement: assert (iscuber(1) == true);
Execution Result:
Let's analyze the provided IR code step-by-step using the given input `iscuber(1)`.

**Step 1: Function Call and Initialization**

* The code starts with a function call `iscuber(1)`. This means we're invoking the function `iscuber` and passing the integer value `1` as an argument.

* Inside the `iscuber` function, the argument `%0` (representing the input `1`) is used as the input to the `llvm.abs.i32` intrinsic function.

*  `llvm.abs.i32` calculates the absolute value of `%0`. Since `%0` is `1`, its absolute value is also `1`. This result is stored in the `%2` register.

**Step 2: Loop Initialization**

* The code then branches to label `3`, which marks the beginning of a loop.

* Inside the loop, we initialize a counter variable `%4` to `0`.

**Step 3: Loop Iteration**

*  The loop iterates as follows:
    * `%5 = mul nsw i32 %4, %4`:  Multiply the current value of `%4` by itself (squaring).
    * `%6 = mul nsw i32 %5, %4`: Multiply the result from the previous step by `%4` again (cubing).
    * `%7 = icmp ult i32 %6, %2`: Compare if the cubed value `%6` is less than the absolute input value `%2` (which is `1`).
    * `%8 = add nuw nsw i32 %4, 1`: Increment the counter `%4` by `1`.
    * `br i1 %7, label %3, label %9`: If `%6` is less than `%2`, jump back to the beginning of the loop (label `3`). Otherwise, proceed to label `9`.

**Step 4: Loop Termination and Result**

* Since `1` cubed (`1 * 1 * 1`) is `1`, which is equal to the input, the loop will terminate after the first iteration.

* The code jumps to label `9`.

* `%10 = icmp ule i32 %6, %2`: This compares if the cubed value `%6` is less than or equal to the absolute input value `%2`. In this case, `%6` is `1`, which is equal to `%2`.

* `ret i1 %10`: The function returns the boolean value `true` because `%6` is less than or equal to `%2`.

**Final Output:**

The function `iscuber(1)` returns `true`.

**Verification:**

The result is correct because 1 is indeed a perfect cube (1 * 1 * 1 = 1).

Let's break down the execution of the provided IR code step-by-step for the input `iscuber(-1)`.

**Understanding the Code**

This IR code defines a function called `iscuber` which aims to determine if the input integer is a perfect cube. Here's a breakdown:

* **`%2 = tail call i32 @llvm.abs.i32(i32 %0, i1 true)`:** This line calculates the absolute value of the input `%0` (which is -1 in our case) and stores it in `%2`. The `llvm.abs.i32` is an intrinsic function for calculating the absolute value.

Assert Statement: assert (iscuber(64) == true);
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of the provided LLVM IR code snippet for the input `iscuber(64)`.

**Understanding the Code**

The LLVM IR code defines a function named `iscuber` that checks if a given integer is a perfect cube. Here's a breakdown:

* **Function Signature:**
    * `define dso_local zeroext i1 @_Z7iscuberi(i32 %0) local_unnamed_addr #0`: This line defines the function `iscuber` which takes a 32-bit integer (`i32`) as input (`%0`) and returns a 1-bit integer (`i1`), likely representing true (1) or false (0).

* **Absolute Value:**
    * `%2 = tail call i32 @llvm.abs.i32(i32 %0, i1 true)`: This line calculates the absolute value of the input `%0` using the `llvm.abs.i32` intrinsic function. The result is stored in `%2`.

* **Loop:**
    * The code then enters a loop (labeled `3`). This loop iteratively checks if the cube of the current value (`%4`) is less than the absolute value of the input (`%2`).

* **Loop Body:**
    * `%4 = phi i32 [ 0, %1 ], [ %8, %3 ]`: This is a PHI node, which merges values from different basic blocks. It initializes `%4` to 0 at the beginning of the loop and updates it with the value of `%8` in subsequent iterations.

    * `br i1 %7, label %3, label %9, !llvm.loop !3`: Branches to the beginning of the loop (`label %3`) if `%7` is true (cube is less than the absolute value), otherwise it jumps to `label %9`.

* **Post-Loop:**
    * `%10 = icmp ule i32 %6, %2`: Checks if the cube of `%4` is less than or equal to the absolute value of the input.
    * `ret i1 %10`: Returns the result of the comparison (`%10`) as a 1-bit integer.

**Execution with Input 64**

2. **Absolute Value:** `%2` is set to `abs(64)`, which is 64.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   * **Iteration 1:**
      * `%4` is initialized to 0.
      * `%6` (cube of `%4`) is 0.
      * `%7` is false (0 because 0 < 64 is true).
      * The loop continues.
   * **Iteration 2:**
      * `%4` is incremented to 1.
      * `%6` (cube of `%4`) is 1.
      * `%7` is false (1 < 64 is true).
      * The loop continues.
   * ... (Iterations continue until `%4` reaches 4)
   * **Iteration 5:**
      * `%4` is 4.
      * `%6` (cube of `%4`) is 64.
      * `%7` is false (64 <= 64 is true).
      * The loop terminates and jumps to `label %9`.

4. **Post-Loop:**
   * `%10` is set to true (64 <= 64 is true).
   * The function returns `true` (1).



**Final Output:**

The function `iscuber(64)` returns `true` because 64 is a perfect cube (4 * 4 * 4 = 64).

Assert Statement: assert (iscuber(180) == false);
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of the provided LLVM IR code step-by-step for the input `iscuber(180)`.

**Understanding the Code**

The IR code defines a function named `iscuber` that takes an integer argument and determines if it's a perfect cube. Here's a high-level explanation:

1. **Absolute Value:** It starts by calculating the absolute value of the input using the `llvm.abs.i32` intrinsic function.

2. **Iteration:** It enters a loop that iterates, incrementally increasing a counter (`%4`).

3. **Cube Calculation:** Inside the loop, it calculates the cube of the counter (`%5 * %4`).

4. **Comparison:** It compares the cube with the absolute value of the input. If the cube is less than the absolute input, the loop continues.

5. **Result:** Once the cube becomes greater than or equal to the absolute input, the loop terminates, and the function returns `true` if the cube is equal to the absolute input, otherwise `false`.

**Step-by-Step Execution for `iscuber(180)`**

1. **Input:** `%0` (the input argument) is set to 180.

2. **Absolute Value:** `%2 = tail call i32 @llvm.abs.i32(i32 %0, i1 true)` calculates the absolute value of 180, which is 180.

3. **Initialization:** `%4` is initialized to 0.

4. **Loop Iteration 1:**
   - `%5 = mul nsw i32 %4, %4` : %5 is 0 (0 * 0).
   - `%6 = mul nsw i32 %5, %4` : %6 is 0 (0 * 0).
   - `%7 = icmp ult i32 %6, %2` : %7 is true (0 < 180).
   - `%8 = add nuw nsw i32 %4, 1` : %8 is 1 (0 + 1).

5. **Loop Iteration 2:**
   - `%4` is now 1.
   - `%5 = mul nsw i32 %4, %4` : %5 is 1 (1 * 1).
   - `%6 = mul nsw i32 %5, %4` : %6 is 1 (1 * 1).
   - `%7 = icmp ult i32 %6, %2` : %7 is true (1 < 180).
   - `%8 = add nuw nsw i32 %4, 1` : %8 is 2.

6. **Loop Iteration 3:**
   - `%4` is now 2.
   - ... (similar calculations)
   - ... %7 is true.

7. **Loop Continues:** The loop continues in this manner, incrementing `%4` and calculating its cube.

8. **Loop Termination:** Eventually, the cube of `%4` will exceed 180, and `%7` will become false.

9. **Final Comparison:**
   - `%10 = icmp ule i32 %6, %2` : This compares the last calculated cube with 180. Since the cube will be greater than 180, %10 will be false.

10. **Return:** The function returns `false` because the input 180 is not a perfect cube.



**Final Output:**

The function `iscuber(180)` returns `false`.

**Verification:**

The result is correct because 180 is not a perfect cube (the cube root of 180 is not an integer).

Assert Statement: assert (iscuber(1000) == true);
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of the provided IR code step-by-step.

**Understanding the Code**

The IR code defines a function named `iscuber` which aims to determine if a given integer is a perfect cube. Here's a breakdown:

* **Input:** The function takes a signed 32-bit integer (`i32`) as input, represented by the argument `%0`.
* **Functionality:**

    * It first calculates the absolute value of the input using the `llvm.abs.i32` intrinsic function.
    * Then, it enters a loop that iteratively:
        * Calculates the cube of the current loop counter (`%4`).
        * Compares this cube to the absolute value of the input.
        * If the cube is less than the absolute input, it increments the counter and continues the loop.
        * If the cube is greater than or equal to the absolute input, it exits the loop.
    * Finally, it returns `true` if the cube of the last counter value is less than or equal to the absolute input, otherwise it returns `false`.

**Executing with Input 1000**

Let's execute the code with the input `1000`:

1. **Input:** `%0 = 1000`

2. **Absolute Value:** `%2 = tail call i32 @llvm.abs.i32(i32 %0, i1 true)` 
   * `%2` will be 1000 (absolute value of 1000).

3. **Loop Initialization:**
   * `%4 = phi i32 [ 0, %1 ], [ %8, %3 ]` 
     *  `%4` is initialized to 0.

4. **Loop Iteration 1:**
   * `%5 = mul nsw i32 %4, %4`  (`%5 = 0`)
   * `%6 = mul nsw i32 %5, %4` (`%6 = 0`)
   * `%7 = icmp ult i32 %6, %2` (`%7 = true` since 0 < 1000)
   * `%8 = add nuw nsw i32 %4, 1` (`%8 = 1`)

5. **Loop Iteration 2:**
   * `%4 = phi i32 [ 0, %1 ], [ 1, %3 ]` (`%4 = 1`)
   * `%5 = mul nsw i32 %4, %4` (`%5 = 1`)
   * `%6 = mul nsw i32 %5, %4` (`%6 = 1`)
   * `%7 = icmp ult i32 %6, %2` (`%7 = true` since 1 < 1000)
   * `%8 = add nuw nsw i32 %4, 1` (`%8 = 2`)

6. **... Subsequent Iterations ...**

   The loop continues, incrementing `%4` and calculating its cube (`%6`) until `%6` becomes greater than or equal to 1000.

7. **Loop Exit:**

   Eventually, the loop will terminate when `%4` reaches 10, as 10 * 10 * 10 = 1000. At this point, `%7` will be `false`.

8. **Final Comparison:**
   * `%10 = icmp ule i32 %6, %2` (`%10 = true` since 1000 <= 1000)

9. **Return:**
   * `ret i1 %10` The function returns `true`.

**Output:** 
The function `iscuber(1000)` returns `true`, confirming that 1000 is indeed a perfect cube.

Assert Statement: assert (iscuber(0) == true);
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of this IR code step-by-step.

**Understanding the Code**

The provided code defines a function `iscuber` that checks if a given integer is a perfect cube. Here's a breakdown:

* **Input:** The function takes a signed 32-bit integer (`i32`) as input.
* **Logic:** It iteratively calculates the cube of numbers starting from 0 and compares it with the absolute value of the input. If the cube becomes greater than or equal to the absolute input, it stops and returns `true` if the cube is equal to the absolute input, otherwise `false`.
* **Output:** The function returns a boolean value (`i1`), `true` if the input is a perfect cube, `false` otherwise.

**Step-by-Step Execution for Input 0**

1. **Function Call:**  `iscuber(0)` is called.

2. **Absolute Value:** 
   - `%2 = tail call i32 @llvm.abs.i32(i32 %0, i1 true)` calculates the absolute value of the input, which is 0 in this case.

3. **Initialization:**
   - `%4 = phi i32 [ 0, %1 ], [ %8, %3 ]` initializes a loop counter `%4` to 0.

4. **Loop Iteration 1:**
   - `%5 = mul nsw i32 %4, %4` calculates `%4 * %4` (0 * 0 = 0).
   - `%6 = mul nsw i32 %5, %4` calculates `%5 * %4` (0 * 0 = 0).
   - `%7 = icmp ult i32 %6, %2` compares `%6` (0) with `%2` (0). Since 0 is not less than 0, `%7` is `false`.
   - `%8 = add nuw nsw i32 %4, 1` increments `%4` to 1.
   - As `%7` is `false`, the loop continues.

5. **Loop Iteration 2:**
   - The loop repeats steps 4a-4e with `%4` now being 1.

6. **Loop Exit:**
   - After several iterations, the loop will eventually terminate because `%6` (the cube of `%4`) will become greater than `%2` (0).

7. **Final Comparison:**
   - `%10 = icmp ule i32 %6, %2` compares the final value of `%6` with `%2`. Since `%6` will be greater than `%2`, `%10` will be `false`.

8. **Return:**
   - `ret i1 %10` returns `false` as the final result.



**Final Output:**

The function `iscuber(0)` returns `false`.

**Verification:**

The output is correct because 0 is not a perfect cube of any integer.

   - `dso_local`: Indicates the function is locally visible.
   - `zeroext i1`: Specifies the return type as a single-bit integer (i.e., a boolean value: `true` or `false`).
   - `@_Z7iscuberi`: The function's mangled name.
   - `(i32 %0)`:  Takes a 32-bit integer as input, referred to as `%0` within the function.

      - **Loop Header (Label 3):**
         - `%4 = phi i32 [ 0, %1 ], [ %8, %3 ]`: This is a PHI (phi) node. It merges values from different predecessor blocks.
            - If coming from the entry block (`%1`), `%4` is initialized to 0.
            - If coming from within the loop (`%3`), `%4` takes the value of `%8` from the previous iteration.
         - `%5 = mul nsw i32 %4, %4`: Multiplies `%4` by itself (squares it). `nsw` indicates "no signed wrap" - overflow is not handled.

         - `%7 = icmp ult i32 %6, %2`: Compares `%6` (the cube) with `%2` (the absolute input). Sets a flag based on whether `%6` is unsigned less than `%2`.
         - `%8 = add nuw nsw i32 %4, 1`: Increments `%4` by 1. `nuw` means "no unsigned wrap," `nsw` means "no signed wrap."
         - `br i1 %7, label %3, label %9, !llvm.loop !3`: Conditional branch. If `%7` is true (cube is less than the absolute input), loop back to label `3`. Otherwise, jump to label `9`.

      - **Exit Block (Label 9):**
         - `%10 = icmp ule i32 %6, %2`: Compares `%6` (the cube) with `%2` (the absolute input). Sets a flag based on whether `%6` is unsigned less than or equal to `%2`.
         - `ret i1 %10`: Returns the boolean value represented by `%10`.

**Execution for `iscuber(1729)`**

1. **Input:** `%0 = 1729`

2. **Absolute Value:** `%2 = abs(1729) = 1729`

3. **Loop Iterations:** The loop will iterate, incrementing `%4` until `%6` (the cube of `%4`) becomes greater than or equal to `%2` (1729).

4. **Finding the Cube:** The loop will continue until `%4` reaches 12, at which point `%6` will be 1728.

5. **Comparison:** In the exit block, `%10` will be `false` because `1728` is less than `1729`.

6. **Return:** The function returns `false` because 1729 is not a perfect cube.

**Final Output:** `iscuber(1729) = false`
