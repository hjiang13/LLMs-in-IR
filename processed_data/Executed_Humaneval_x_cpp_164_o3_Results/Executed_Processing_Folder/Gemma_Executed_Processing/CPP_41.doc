Assert Statement: assert (car_race_collision(2) == 4);
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of the provided IR code step-by-step:

**1. Function Definition:**

The code defines a function named `_Z18car_race_collisioni` which takes an integer (`i32`) as input and returns an integer (`i32`).

**2. Input:**

We are given the input `car_race_collision(2)`, meaning the function is called with the argument `2`.

**3. Instruction Execution:**

* **`%2 = mul nsw i32 %0, %0`:** This instruction performs the following:
    * `mul nsw i32`: This indicates a signed multiplication operation on 32-bit integers.
    * `%0`: This represents the input argument to the function, which is `2` in our case.
    * `%2`: This is the destination register where the result of the multiplication will be stored.

   The instruction multiplies the value in `%0` (which is `2`) by itself (`2 * 2`). The result, `4`, is then stored in register `%2`.

* **`ret i32 %2`:** This instruction returns the value stored in register `%2` (which is `4`) as the output of the function.

**4. Final Output:**

The function returns the value `4`.

**Verification:**

The result `4` is indeed the correct output for `car_race_collision(2)` as `2 * 2 = 4`.

**Therefore, the execution of the IR code with the given input is correct.**

Assert Statement: assert (car_race_collision(3) == 9);
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of this IR code step-by-step:

**Understanding the Code**

The provided IR code defines a function named `car_race_collision`. This function takes a single integer argument (`%0`) and returns the square of that integer.

Here's a line-by-line explanation:

* `define dso_local i32 @_Z18car_race_collisioni(i32 %0) local_unnamed_addr #0 {`: This line defines the function signature.
    * `define dso_local i32`:  This indicates the function is defined locally within the current module and returns a 32-bit integer (`i32`).
    * `@_Z18car_race_collisioni`: This is the mangled name of the function (how C++ names are represented in assembly-like code).
    * `(i32 %0)`: This specifies that the function takes a single 32-bit integer argument, named `%0` within the function.
    * `local_unnamed_addr #0`: This indicates the function has local linkage (only accessible within the current module) and refers to a set of attributes (#0) defined later.

* `%2 = mul nsw i32 %0, %0`: This line performs the core calculation.
    * `%2 =`: The result of the multiplication will be stored in a new variable named `%2`.
    * `mul nsw i32`: This is a "multiply signed with no wrap" instruction, meaning it multiplies two signed 32-bit integers and doesn't handle overflow.
    * `%0, %0`: The two operands being multiplied are both the input argument `%0`.

* `ret i32 %2`: This line returns the result.
    * `ret`: This is the "return" instruction.
    * `i32 %2`: The function returns the value stored in `%2` (the result of the multiplication).

**Executing with Input 3**

1. **Input:**  We're given the input `car_race_collision(3)`, meaning `%0` will have the value 3.

2. **Multiplication:** The line `%2 = mul nsw i32 %0, %0` calculates 3 * 3.

3. **Result:** The result of 3 * 3 is 9, which is stored in `%2`.

4. **Return:** The `ret i32 %2` instruction returns the value 9.

**Verification:**

The assertion `assert (car_race_collision(3) == 9);` is **correct** because the function correctly calculates the square of the input (3 * 3 = 9).

Assert Statement: assert (car_race_collision(4) == 16);
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of this IR code step-by-step.

**Understanding the Code**

The provided IR code defines a function named `car_race_collision`. This function takes an integer as input (`%0`) and returns the square of that integer.

**Step-by-Step Execution**

1. **Input:** The assert statement `assert (car_race_collision(4) == 16);` provides the input value of `4` to our function.

2. **Multiplication:** The core of the function is the line `%2 = mul nsw i32 %0, %0`. This performs the following:
   - `mul nsw i32`: This indicates a signed multiplication operation on 32-bit integers.
   - `%0`: This represents the input argument to the function, which is `4` in our case.
   - `%0, %0`: This means we are multiplying the input value by itself.
   - `%2`: The result of the multiplication is stored in a temporary variable `%2`.

3. **Return:** The line `ret i32 %2` returns the value stored in `%2` (which is the result of the multiplication) as the output of the function.

**Calculation**

Since the input is `4`, the calculation is:

4 * 4 = 16

**Output**

The function `car_race_collision(4)` returns `16`. This matches the assertion `assert (car_race_collision(4) == 16);`, so the assertion holds true.

**Verification**

The output of the IR code execution is indeed `16`, which is the correct square of the input value `4`.



Let me know if you have any other IR code snippets you'd like to analyze!

Assert Statement: assert (car_race_collision(8) == 64);
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of the provided IR code step by step.

**Understanding the Code**

The IR code defines a function called `car_race_collision` that takes an integer (`i32`) as input and returns an integer. The core operation within the function is:

```llvm
%2 = mul nsw i32 %0, %0
```

This line performs the following:

* `%2`: This is a temporary variable (register) where the result of the multiplication will be stored.
* `mul nsw i32`: This indicates an integer multiplication operation (`mul`). The `nsw` flag stands for "no signed wrap," meaning the result will not overflow if it exceeds the maximum value representable by a 32-bit signed integer.
* `%0, %0`: This specifies that the same input value (`%0`) is multiplied by itself.

Finally, the result stored in `%2` is returned by the function.

**Executing the Code with Input 8**

1. **Input:** The input to the function is `8` (represented as `%0`).

2. **Multiplication:** The code multiplies `8` by `8`.

3. **Result:** The result of `8 * 8` is `64`. This value is stored in the temporary variable `%2`.

4. **Return:** The function returns the value in `%2`, which is `64`.

**Verification**

The `assert` statement `assert (car_race_collision(8) == 64);` checks if the output of the function with input `8` is indeed `64`. Since our step-by-step execution resulted in `64`, the assertion holds true.

**Final Output**

The final output of the `car_race_collision(8)` function is `64`.



Let me know if you have any other IR code snippets you'd like to analyze!

Assert Statement: assert (car_race_collision(10) == 100);
Execution Result:
## Step-by-Step Execution of IR Code:

**Input:** `assert (car_race_collision(10) == 100);`

**IR Code:**

```
define dso_local i32 @_Z18car_race_collisioni(i32 %0) local_unnamed_addr #0 {
  %2 = mul nsw i32 %0, %0
  ret i32 %2
}
```

**Step 1: Function Call:**

The code starts with a function call `car_race_collision(10)`. This means the function `_Z18car_race_collisioni` is being called with the argument `10`.

**Step 2: Argument Passing:**

The argument `10` is passed to the function and stored in the register `%0`.

**Step 3: Multiplication:**

The IR code `%2 = mul nsw i32 %0, %0` performs a signed multiplication (`mul nsw`) of the value in register `%0` (which is 10) by itself.

**Step 4: Result:**

The result of the multiplication (10 * 10 = 100) is stored in register `%2`.

**Step 5: Return:**

The `ret i32 %2` instruction returns the value stored in register `%2` (which is 100) as the result of the function call.

**Step 6: Assertion:**

The assertion `assert (car_race_collision(10) == 100);` checks if the returned value (100) is equal to the expected value (100). Since they are equal, the assertion holds true.

**Final Output:**

The function `car_race_collision(10)` returns the value 100, which satisfies the assertion.

**Verification:**

The execution of the IR code correctly follows the steps outlined above, resulting in the expected output of 100. The assertion is successfully verified.
