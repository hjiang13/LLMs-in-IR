Assert Statement: assert (issame(even_odd_count(7) , {0, 1}));
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of this IR code step-by-step.

**Understanding the Code**

This IR code defines a function `even_odd_count` which takes an integer as input and returns a vector containing the counts of even and odd numbers up to that integer.

**Step-by-Step Execution**

1. **Initialization:**
   - The function starts by taking the

Assert Statement: assert (issame(even_odd_count(-78) , {1, 1}));
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of this LLVM IR code step-by-step.

**Understanding the Code**

This IR code defines a function called `even_odd_count`. It takes an integer as input and returns a pair of integers representing the counts of even and odd numbers within the range from 1 to the input integer.

**Step-by-Step Execution**

1. **

Assert Statement: assert (issame(even_odd_count(3452) , {2, 2}));
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of the provided IR code step-by-step, focusing on how it processes the input `3452` and arrives at the expected output `{2, 2}`.

**Understanding the Code**

This IR code implements a function called `even_odd_count`. Its purpose is to analyze a given integer and return a vector containing two elements:

Assert Statement: assert (issame(even_odd_count(346211) , {3, 3}));
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of this LLVM IR code step by step.

**Understanding the Code**

The LLVM IR code defines a function `even_odd_count` that takes an integer as input and returns a pair of integers representing the count of even and odd digits in the input.

**Step-by-Step Execution**

1. **Input:** The input to

Assert Statement: assert (issame(even_odd_count(-345821) , {3, 3}));
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of the provided LLVM IR code step by step.

**Understanding the Code**

This LLVM IR code implements a function called `even_odd_count`. This function takes an integer as input and returns a pair of integers representing the counts of even and odd numbers in the absolute value of the input.

**Step-by-Step Execution**

1

Assert Statement: assert (issame(even_odd_count(-2) , {1, 0}));
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of this LLVM IR code step-by-step, focusing on how it processes the input `-2`.

**Understanding the Code**

The code implements a function `even_odd_count` that takes an integer as input and returns a pair of integers:

* The first integer represents the count of even numbers from 0 up to (and including) the input.

Assert Statement: assert (issame(even_odd_count(-45347) , {2, 3}));
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of the provided IR code step by step.

**Understanding the Code**

This IR code defines a function named `even_odd_count` that takes an integer as input and returns a pair of integers: the count of even digits and the count of odd digits in the input integer.

**Step-by-Step Execution**

1. **Initialization

Assert Statement: assert (issame(even_odd_count(0) , {1, 0}));
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of the provided IR code step-by-step, focusing on the logic and how it relates to the `even_odd_count(0)` function call.

**Understanding the IR Code**

This IR code defines a function `even_odd_count` that takes an integer as input and likely returns a vector containing the counts of even and odd numbers within a range (
