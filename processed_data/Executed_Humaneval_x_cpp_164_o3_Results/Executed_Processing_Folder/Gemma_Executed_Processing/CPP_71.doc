Assert Statement: assert (abs(triangle_area(3, 4, 5)-6.00)<0.01);
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of the provided IR code step by step. 

**Understanding the Code**

This IR code defines a function called `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle given the lengths of its three sides. It uses Heron's formula for this calculation.

**Step-by-Step Execution with Input (3, 4, 5)**

1. **Input:** We're given the side lengths as input: 
   * `%0 = 3`
   * `%1 = 4`
   * `%2 = 5`

2. **Line 4:** `%4 = fadd float %0, %1` 
   * This adds the first two side lengths: `3 + 4 = 7`. The result (`7`) is stored in the temporary variable `%4`.

3. **Line 5:** `%5 = fcmp ugt float %4, %2`
   * This compares if `%4` (7) is greater than `%2` (5). Since 7 is greater than 5, the result (`%5`) is `true` (represented as 1 in IR).

4. **Line 6:** `%6 = fadd float %0, %2`
   * This adds the first and third side lengths: `3 + 5 = 8`. The result (`8`) is stored in the temporary variable `%6`.

5. **Line 7:** `%7 = fcmp ugt float %6, %1`
   * This compares if `%6` (8) is greater than `%1` (4). Since 8 is greater than 4, the result (`%7`) is `true` (represented as 1 in IR).

6. **Line 8:** `%8 = and i1 %5, %7`
   * This performs a logical AND operation on `%5` (true) and `%7` (true). Since both are true, the result (`%8`) is `true` (represented as 1 in IR).

7. **Line 9:** `%9 = fadd float %1, %2`
   * This adds the second and third side lengths: `4 + 5 = 9`. The result (`9`) is stored in the temporary variable `%9`.

8. **Line 10:** `%10 = fcmp ugt float %9, %0`
   * This compares if `%9` (9) is greater than `%0` (3). Since 9 is greater than 3, the result (`%10`) is `true` (represented as 1 in IR).

9. **Line 11:** `%11 = select i1 %8, i1 %10, i1 false`
   * This is a conditional statement. Since `%8` (true) is true, it selects the value of `%10` (true) and stores it in `%11`.

10. **Line 11 (cont.):** `br i1 %11, label %12, label %24`
    * This is a branch instruction. Since `%11` is true, the execution jumps to label `%12`.

11. **Line 12:**  (Label `%12`)
    * This is the start of a code block executed only if the triangle inequality holds (the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side).

12. **Line 13:** `%13 = fadd float %4, %2`
    * This adds `%4` (7) and `%2` (5) : `7 + 5 = 12`. The result (`12`) is stored in `%13`.

13. **Line 14:** `%14 = fmul float %13, 5.000000e-01`
    * This multiplies `%13` (12) by 0.5: `12 * 0.5 = 6`. The result (`6`) is stored in `%14`.

14. **Line 15:** `%15 = fsub float %14, %0`
    * This subtracts `%0` (3) from `%14` (6): `6 - 3 = 3`. The result (`3`) is stored in `%15`.

15. **Lines 16-20:** These lines perform a series of multiplications and subtractions, implementing part of Heron's formula.

16. **Line 21:** `%21 = fpext float %20 to double`
    * This converts the floating-point value in `%20` to a double-precision floating-point value.

17. **Line 22:** `%22 = tail call double @pow(double %21, double 5.000000e-01)`
    * This calls the `pow` function (likely a library function) to calculate the square root of `%21`.

18. **Line 23:** `%23 = fptrunc double %22 to float`
    * This converts the result of the `pow` function (a double) back to a single-precision floating-point value.

19. **Line 23 (cont.):** `br label %24`
    * This jumps to label `%24`.

20. **Line 24:** (Label `%24`)
    * This is a merge point for the two code paths (triangle inequality true or false).

21. **Line 25:** `%25 = phi float [ %23, %12 ], [ -1.000000e+00, %3 ]`
    * This selects the appropriate value for the area:
        * If the triangle inequality was true (we came from label `%12`), it selects `%23` (the calculated area).
        * Otherwise, it selects `-1.000000e+00` (likely indicating an invalid triangle).

22. **Line 25 (cont.):** `ret float %25`
    * This returns the calculated area (`%25`).



**Final Output:**

The function `triangle_area(3, 4, 5)` will return a value close to `6.00`.

**Verification:**

The result is consistent with Heron's formula for calculating the area of a triangle.

Assert Statement: assert (abs(triangle_area(1, 2, 10) +1)<0.01);
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of this IR code step-by-step.

**Understanding the Code**

This IR code defines a function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle given the lengths of its three sides using Heron's formula.

**Step-by-Step Execution**

1. **Function Entry:**
   - The function `triangle_area` is called with arguments `%0`, `%1`, and `%2` representing the side lengths of the triangle.

2. **Sum of Sides:**
   - `%4 = fadd float %0, %1`: The sum of the first two sides (`%0` and `%1`) is calculated and stored in `%4`.

3. **Triangle Inequality Check (Part 1):**
   - `%5 = fcmp ugt float %4, %2`: This instruction compares the sum of the first two sides (`%4`) with the third side (`%2`). It sets `%5` to 1 (true) if `%4` is greater than `%2`, indicating the triangle inequality holds for these sides, otherwise 0 (false).

4. **Triangle Inequality Check (Part 2):**
   - `%6 = fadd float %0, %2`: The sum of the first and third sides is calculated and stored in `%6`.
   - `%7 = fcmp ugt float %6, %1`: This compares the sum of the first and third sides (`%6`) with the second side (`%1`), setting `%7` to 1 (true) if `%6` is greater than `%1`, otherwise 0 (false).

5. **Combined Inequality Check:**
   - `%8 = and i1 %5, %7`: This performs a logical AND operation on `%5` and `%7`. The result, stored in `%8`, will be 1 (true) only if both triangle inequality checks passed.

6. **Triangle Inequality Check (Part 3):**
   - `%9 = fadd float %1, %2`: The sum of the second and third sides is calculated and stored in `%9`.
   - `%10 = fcmp ugt float %9, %0`: This compares the sum of the second and third sides (`%9`) with the first side (`%0`), setting `%10` to 1 (true) if `%9` is greater than `%0`, otherwise 0 (false).

7. **Final Inequality Check and Branching:**
   - `%11 = select i1 %8, i1 %10, i1 false`: This instruction selects `%10` if `%8` (combined inequality check) is true, otherwise it selects `false`.
   - `br i1 %11, label %12, label %24`: Based on the result in `%11`, the execution branches to either label `%12` (if `%11` is true) or label `%24` (if `%11` is false).

8. **Calculation (If Triangle Inequality Holds):**
   - If the triangle inequality holds (branch to `%12`):
     - `%13 = fadd float %4, %2`: Sum of the first two sides plus the third side.
     - `%14 = fmul float %13, 5.000000e-01`: Half the perimeter of the triangle.
     - `%15 = fsub float %14, %0`: Subtracting the first side from half the perimeter.
     - `%16 = fmul float %14, %15`: Multiplying half the perimeter by the result of the previous subtraction.
     - `%17 = fsub float %14, %1`: Subtracting the second side from half the perimeter.
     - `%18 = fmul float %17, %16`: Multiplying the result of the previous subtraction with `%16`.
     - `%19 = fsub float %14, %2`: Subtracting the third side from half the perimeter.
     - `%20 = fmul float %19, %18`: Multiplying the result of the previous subtraction with `%18`.
     - `%21 = fpext float %20 to double`: Converting `%20` to a double-precision floating-point number.
     - `%22 = tail call double @pow(double %21, double 5.000000e-01)`: Calling the `pow` function to calculate the square root of `%21`.
     - `%23 = fptrunc double %22 to float`: Converting the result of `pow` back to a single-precision floating-point number.
     - `br label %24`: Unconditional branch to label `%24`.

9. **Return Value (If Triangle Inequality Doesn't Hold):**
   - If the triangle inequality doesn't hold (branch to `%24`):
     - `%25 = phi float [ %23, %12 ], [ -1.000000e+00, %3 ]`: Selecting the calculated area (`%23`) if the inequality holds, otherwise returning `-1.000000e+00`.
     - `ret float %25`: Returning the calculated area or -1.000000e+00.

**Execution with Input (1, 2, 10)**

Given the input `triangle_area(1, 2, 10)`, the triangle inequality doesn't hold because 1 + 2 is not greater than 10. Therefore, the execution will branch to label `%24` and return `-1.000000e+00`.

**Verification**

The assert statement `assert (abs(triangle_area(1, 2, 10) +1)<0.01)` will fail because `triangle_area(1, 2, 10)` returns `-1.000000e+00`, and `abs(-1.000000e+00 + 1)` is not less than 0.01.

Assert Statement: assert (abs(triangle_area(4, 8, 5) -8.18)<0.01);
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of the provided IR code step-by-step for the input `triangle_area(4, 8, 5)`.

**Understanding the Code:**

The IR code represents a function named `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle given the lengths of its three sides. Here's a high-level explanation:

1. **Input:** The function takes three floating-point arguments: `%0`, `%1`, and `%2`, representing the side lengths.

2. **Triangle Inequality Check:** The code first checks if the triangle inequality holds (the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side) using a series of comparisons (`fcmp ugt`) and logical AND (`and i1`).

3. **Heron's Formula:** If the triangle inequality is satisfied, the code proceeds to calculate the area using Heron's formula:

   * Calculate the semi-perimeter (`%13`).
   * Apply Heron's formula to compute the area.

4. **Output:** The function returns the calculated area as a floating-point value.

**Step-by-Step Execution:**

Let's execute the code with the input `triangle_area(4, 8, 5)`:

1. **Initialization:**
   * `%0 = 4.0`
   * `%1 = 8.0`
   * `%2 = 5.0`

2. **Triangle Inequality Check:**
   * `%4 = fadd float %0, %1 = 12.0`
   * `%5 = fcmp ugt float %4, %2 = true` (12.0 > 5.0)
   * `%6 = fadd float %0, %2 = 9.0`
   * `%7 = fcmp ugt float %6, %1 = false` (9.0 not > 8.0)
   * `%8 = and i1 %5, %7 = false` (Both conditions must be true)

3. **Heron's Formula (Not Executed):** The triangle inequality fails, so the code skips the Heron's formula calculation.

4. **Return:**
   * `%25 = -1.000000e+00` (Default return value if triangle inequality fails)
   * `ret float %25`

**Final Output:**

The function returns `-1.000000e+00` because the input side lengths do not satisfy the triangle inequality.

**Verification:**

The output `-1.000000e+00` indicates that the triangle with sides 4, 8, and 5 cannot be formed. This is correct, as the triangle inequality is violated.

**Note:**

The IR code includes a call to the `pow` function, but it is not executed in this case because the triangle inequality check fails.

Assert Statement: assert (abs(triangle_area(2, 2, 2) -1.73)<0.01);
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of this IR code step-by-step.

**Understanding the Code**

This IR code defines a function called `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle given the lengths of its three sides using Heron's formula.

**Step-by-Step Execution**

We'll use the input values `2, 2, 2` for the sides of the triangle.

1. **Input:**
   - `%0 = 2.0` (Side 1)
   - `%1 = 2.0` (Side 2)
   - `%2 = 2.0` (Side 3)

2. **Calculate Semi-Perimeter:**
   - `%4 = fadd float %0, %1`  => `%4 = 4.0` (Sum of Side 1 and Side 2)

3. **Triangle Inequality Checks:**
   - `%5 = fcmp ugt float %4, %2` => `%5 = true` (Is the sum of Side 1 and Side 2 greater than Side 3?)
   - `%6 = fadd float %0, %2` => `%6 = 4.0` (Sum of Side 1 and Side 3)
   - `%7 = fcmp ugt float %6, %1` => `%7 = true` (Is the sum of Side 1 and Side 3 greater than Side 2?)
   - `%8 = and i1 %5, %7` => `%8 = true` (Are both triangle inequality conditions true?)
   - `%9 = fadd float %1, %2` => `%9 = 4.0` (Sum of Side 2 and Side 3)
   - `%10 = fcmp ugt float %9, %0` => `%10 = true` (Is the sum of Side 2 and Side 3 greater than Side 1?)
   - `%11 = select i1 %8, i1 %10, i1 false` => `%11 = true` (If both initial conditions are true, use the result of the third condition)

4. **Calculate Area (if triangle inequality holds):**

   - Since `%11` is `true`, we proceed to calculate the area:
   - `%13 = fadd float %4, %2` => `%13 = 6.0`
   - `%14 = fmul float %13, 5.000000e-01` => `%14 = 3.0` (Half of the perimeter)
   - `%15 = fsub float %14, %0` => `%15 = 1.0`
   - `%16 = fmul float %14, %15` => `%16 = 3.0`
   - `%17 = fsub float %14, %1` => `%17 = 1.0`
   - `%18 = fmul float %17, %16` => `%18 = 3.0`
   - `%19 = fsub float %14, %2` => `%19 = 1.0`
   - `%20 = fmul float %19, %18` => `%20 = 3.0`
   - `%21 = fpext float %20 to double` => `%21 = 3.0` (Convert to double precision)
   - `%22 = tail call double @pow(double %21, double 5.000000e-01)` => `%22 = 1.7320508075688772` (Calculate square root using pow function)
   - `%23 = fptrunc double %22 to float` => `%23 = 1.7320508` (Convert back to float)

5. **Return Result:**

   - `%25 = phi float [ %23, %12 ], [ -1.000000e+00, %3 ]` => `%25 = 1.7320508` (Select the calculated area)
   - `ret float %25` => Return the calculated area (`1.7320508`)

**Final Output:**

The function `triangle_area(2, 2, 2)` returns approximately **1.7320508**.

**Verification:**

The calculated result is very close to the expected value of the square root of 3 (approximately 1.732) for an equilateral triangle with sides of length 2. The small difference is due to floating-point precision.

Therefore, the execution of the IR code is correct.

Assert Statement: assert (abs(triangle_area(1, 2, 3) +1)<0.01);
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of the provided IR code step-by-step:

**Understanding the Function**

The IR code defines a function named `triangle_area` which takes three floating-point arguments (`%0`, `%1`, and `%2`) representing the side lengths of a triangle. Its purpose is to calculate the area of the triangle using Heron's formula.

**Step-by-Step Execution**

1. **Input:**
   - We are given the input values: `1`, `2`, and `3` corresponding to `%0`, `%1`, and `%2` respectively.

2. **Initial Calculations:**

   - `%4 = fadd float %0, %1` :  `%4` = 1 + 2 = 3.0
   - `%5 = fcmp ugt float %4, %2` :  Is `%4` (3.0) greater than `%2` (3)?  False. `%5` is set to 0 (false).
   - `%6 = fadd float %0, %2` : `%6` = 1 + 3 = 4.0
   - `%7 = fcmp ugt float %6, %1`: Is `%6` (4.0) greater than `%1` (2)? True. `%7` is set to 1 (true).
   - `%8 = and i1 %5, %7` : Logical AND of `%5` (0) and `%7` (1) results in 0 (false).

3. **Conditional Branch:**
   - `br i1 %11, label %12, label %24`: Since `%8` is 0 (false), the code branches to label `%24`.

4. **Direct Return:**
   - `%25 = phi float [ %23, %12 ], [ -1.000000e+00, %3 ]`: Since we didn't reach label `%12`, `%25` is assigned the value `-1.000000e+00` (-1.0).

5. **Return Value:**
   - `ret float %25`: The function returns the value in `%25`, which is -1.0.

**Verification**

The function returns `-1.0`. This indicates that the input side lengths do not satisfy the triangle inequality theorem (the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side). Heron's formula cannot be applied in this case.

**Final Output:**

```
-1.0 
```

**Verification and Evaluation:**

- **Correctness Check:** The output is correct based on the logic of the function and the triangle inequality theorem.
- **Errors or Deviations:** None observed.
- **Overall Accuracy Score:** 100%

**Important Note:**

The `assert` statement provided (`assert (abs(triangle_area(1, 2, 3) +1)<0.01);`) would fail because the function returns `-1.0`, and `abs(-1.0 + 1)` is `0.0`, which is not less than `0.01`.

Assert Statement: assert (abs(triangle_area(10, 5, 7) - 16.25)<0.01);
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of this IR code step-by-step.

**Understanding the Code**

The provided IR code represents a function named `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle given the lengths of its three sides. Here's a high-level explanation:

1. **Input:** The function takes three floating-point numbers (`%0`, `%1`, `%2`) representing the side lengths.

2. **Triangle Inequality Check:** The code first checks if the triangle inequality holds (the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side). If not, it returns -1.0, indicating an invalid triangle.

3. **Heron's Formula:** If the triangle inequality is satisfied, the code proceeds to calculate the area using Heron's formula:

   * Calculate the semi-perimeter (half the sum of the sides).
   * Calculate the area using the formula: `sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c))`, where `s` is the semi-perimeter and `a`, `b`, and `c` are the side lengths.

**Step-by-Step Execution for `triangle_area(10, 5, 7)`**

1. **Input Values:** `%0 = 10`, `%1 = 5`, `%2 = 7`

2. **Triangle Inequality Check:**
   * `%4 = fadd float %0, %1`  => `%4 = 15`
   * `%5 = fcmp ugt float %4, %2` => `%5 = true` (15 > 7)
   * `%6 = fadd float %0, %2` => `%6 = 17`
   * `%7 = fcmp ugt float %6, %1` => `%7 = true` (17 > 5)
   * `%8 = and i1 %5, %7` => `%8 = true` (both conditions are true)
   * `%9 = fadd float %1, %2` => `%9 = 12`
   * `%10 = fcmp ugt float %9, %0` => `%10 = false` (12 is not greater than 10)
   * `%11 = select i1 %8, i1 %10, i1 false` => `%11 = false` (selects `%10` because `%8` is true)
   * Since `%11` is `false`, the code jumps to label `24`.

3. **Area Calculation:**

   * The code skips the calculation block (label `12`) because the triangle inequality check failed (`%11 = false`).

4. **Return Value:**
   * `%25 = phi float [ %23, %12 ], [ -1.000000e+00, %3 ]` => `%25 = -1.000000e+00` (since we jumped to label `24` directly)
   * `ret float %25` => The function returns `-1.000000e+00`.

**Verification**

The assertion `assert (abs(triangle_area(10, 5, 7) - 16.25)<0.01);` will fail because the function returns -1.0, not a value close to 16.25. This is because the provided side lengths (10, 5, 7) do not satisfy the triangle inequality.



Let me know if you would like to see the execution for a valid triangle!

Assert Statement: assert (abs(triangle_area(2, 6, 3) +1)<0.01);
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of the provided IR code step-by-step.

**Understanding the Code**

The given IR code defines a function called `triangle_area` which calculates the area of a triangle given the lengths of its three sides. It uses Heron's formula for this calculation.

**Step-by-step Execution**

We'll use the input values provided in the assertion: `triangle_area(2, 6, 3)`.

1. **Initialization:**

   - `%0 = 2.0` (first side)
   - `%1 = 6.0` (second side)
   - `%2 = 3.0` (third side)

2. **Sum of Two Sides:**

   - `%4 = fadd float %0, %1`  => `%4 = 8.0` (sum of the first and second sides)
   - `%6 = fadd float %0, %2`  => `%6 = 5.0` (sum of the first and third sides)
   - `%9 = fadd float %1, %2`  => `%9 = 9.0` (sum of the second and third sides)

3. **Triangle Inequality Check:**

   - `%5 = fcmp ugt float %4, %2` => `%5 = true` (8.0 > 3.0)
   - `%7 = fcmp ugt float %6, %1` => `%7 = true` (5.0 > 6.0)
   - `%8 = and i1 %5, %7` => `%8 = false` (both conditions must be true)
   - `%10 = fcmp ugt float %9, %0` => `%10 = true` (9.0 > 2.0)

4. **Conditional Branch:**

   - `%11 = select i1 %8, i1 %10, i1 false` => `%11 = false`

   Since `%11` is false, we skip the calculation block and proceed to the "else" part.

5. **Return Default Value:**

   - `%25 = phi float [ %23, %12 ], [ -1.000000e+00, %3 ]` => `%25 = -1.000000e+00`

   We directly return `-1.000000e+00` indicating the triangle inequality is not satisfied.

**Final Output:**

The function returns `-1.000000e+00`.

**Verification:**

The result `-1.000000e+00` indicates that the given side lengths do not satisfy the triangle inequality (the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side). This is indeed true for the input values (2, 6, 3).

Therefore, the execution of the IR code is correct.

Assert Statement: assert (abs(triangle_area(1, 1, 1) -0.43)<0.01);
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of this IR code step-by-step, focusing on the provided input: `triangle_area(1, 1, 1)`.

**Understanding the Code**

This IR code defines a function called `triangle_area` which calculates the area of a triangle given the lengths of its three sides. It uses Heron's formula to compute the area.

**Step-by-Step Execution**

1. **Function Call:** The function `triangle_area` is called with the arguments `1`, `1`, and `1`. These represent the lengths of the three sides of the triangle.

2. **Parameter Assignment:** The input values are assigned to the local variables `%0`, `%1`, and `%2` within the function.

3. **Conditional Checks:**

   - `%4 = fadd float %0, %1` : Adds the first two side lengths (1 + 1 = 2) and stores the result in `%4`.
   - `%5 = fcmp ugt float %4, %2` : Compares `%4` (2) with the third side length (`%2`, which is 1). Since 2 is greater than 1, `%5` will be set to `true` (represented as 1 in IR).
   - Similar comparisons are performed for other side combinations, resulting in `%7` and `%10`.

4. **Logical AND:**  `%8 = and i1 %5, %7`: Performs a logical AND operation on `%5` and `%7`. Since both comparisons were `true`, `%8` will also be `true`.

5. **Conditional Branch:** `br i1 %11, label %12, label %24`: This branch instruction checks the value of `%11`. Since `%8` is `true` and `%10` is `true`, `%11` will be `true`, so the code jumps to the label `%12`.

6. **Heron's Formula Calculation (Label %12):**

   - `%13 = fadd float %4, %2`: Calculates the sum of two sides (2 + 1 = 3) and stores it in `%13`.
   - The subsequent instructions implement Heron's formula: calculating the semi-perimeter, subtracting each side length, multiplying the results, and finally taking the square root (using the `pow` function).

7. **Return Value:**

   - `%25 = phi float [ %23, %12 ], [ -1.000000e+00, %3 ]`: This instruction selects the return value based on which block the code reached. Since we took the branch to `%12`, `%25` will be assigned the value calculated in `%23`, which is the result of Heron's formula.
   - `ret float %25`: The function returns the calculated area.

**Verification**

The final calculated area will be approximately 0.433.  The assertion `abs(triangle_area(1, 1, 1) - 0.43) < 0.01` will pass because the calculated area is within the tolerance of 0.01.

**Final Output**

The function `triangle_area(1, 1, 1)` will return a value approximately equal to **0.433**.



Let me know if you have any other IR code snippets you'd like me to analyze!

Assert Statement: assert (abs(triangle_area(2, 2, 10) +1)<0.01);
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of the provided IR code step by step.

**Understanding the Code**

The IR code represents a function called `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle given the lengths of its three sides. Let's analyze the code:

1. **Function Definition:**
   - `define dso_local float @_Z13triangle_areafff(float %0, float %1, float %2) local_unnamed_addr #0`
     - This line defines a function named `_Z13triangle_areafff` (a mangled name for `triangle_area`). It takes three floating-point arguments (`%0`, `%1`, `%2`) representing the side lengths and returns a floating-point value (the area).

2. **Input Parameters:**
   - The function takes three input parameters, which we'll refer to as `a`, `b`, and `c` for clarity:
     - `%0` : `a` (first side)
     - `%1` : `b` (second side)
     - `%2` : `c` (third side)

3. **Triangle Inequality Check:**
   - The code first checks if the triangle inequality holds (the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side):
     - `%4 = fadd float %0, %1` (calculate `a + b`)
     - `%5 = fcmp ugt float %4, %2` (check if `a + b > c`)
     - `%6 = fadd float %0, %2` (calculate `a + c`)
     - `%7 = fcmp ugt float %6, %1` (check if `a + c > b`)
     - `%8 = and i1 %5, %7` (both inequalities must be true)
     - `%9 = fadd float %1, %2` (calculate `b + c`)
     - `%10 = fcmp ugt float %9, %0` (check if `b + c > a`)
     - `%11 = select i1 %8, i1 %10, i1 false` (if the first two inequalities are true, check the third; otherwise, the triangle is invalid)

4. **Area Calculation (If Valid Triangle):**
   - If the triangle inequality holds (`%11` is true):
     - `%13 = fadd float %4, %2` (calculate `a + b + c`)
     - `%14 = fmul float %13, 5.000000e-01` (calculate half the perimeter)
     - ... (further calculations using Heron's formula to compute the area)

5. **Return Value:**
   - `%25 = phi float [ %23, %12 ], [ -1.000000e+00, %3 ]`
     - This selects the calculated area (`%23`) if the triangle is valid, otherwise returns -1.0.
   - `ret float %25` (return the area)

**Executing with Input (2, 2, 10):**

Now, let's execute the code with the input `triangle_area(2, 2, 10)`:

1. **Input Values:**
   - `a = 2`
   - `b = 2`
   - `c = 10`

2. **Triangle Inequality Check:**
   - `a + b > c` (2 + 2 > 10) is false.
   - The triangle inequality does not hold.

3. **Return Value:**
   - Since the triangle is invalid, the function returns `-1.0`.

**Verification:**

The output of `triangle_area(2, 2, 10)` is `-1.0`, which is correct because the given side lengths do not form a valid triangle.

**Final Output:**

```
-1.0 
```

**Verification of the Assertion:**

The assertion `abs(triangle_area(2, 2, 10) + 1) < 0.01` is **false**.

- `triangle_area(2, 2, 10)` returns `-1.0`.
- `abs(-1.0 + 1) = 0.0`, which is not less than 0.01.
