Assert Statement: assert (is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == false);
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of this IR code step-by-step.

**Understanding the Code**

The provided IR code defines a function called `is_equal_to_sum_even`. This function takes a single 32-bit integer (`i32`) as input and returns a boolean value (`i1`) indicating whether the input is even and greater than 7.

**Step-by-Step Execution for Input 4**

1. **Input:** The input to the function is `4`.

2. **Line 7: `%2 = and i32 %0, 1`** 
   - This line performs a bitwise AND operation between the input `%0` (which is 4) and the value 1.
   -  In binary, 4 is represented as `00000100` and 1 as `00000001`.
   - The result of the AND operation is `00000000`, which is 0.

3. **Line 8: `%3 = icmp eq i32 %2, 0`**
   - This line compares the result from the previous step (`%2`, which is 0) with 0. 
   - Since they are equal, the result of this comparison is `true` (represented as 1 in IR).

4. **Line 9: `%4 = icmp sgt i32 %0, 7`**
   - This line compares the input `%0` (which is 4) with 7.
   - Since 4 is less than 7, the result of this comparison is `false` (represented as 0 in IR).

5. **Line 10: `%5 = and i1 %4, %3`**
   - This line performs a bitwise AND operation between the results of the previous two comparisons (`%4` which is 0, and `%3` which is 1).
   - Since one of the operands is 0, the result is `0`, which represents `false`.

6. **Line 11: `ret i1 %5`**
   - The function returns the result from the previous step (`%5`), which is `false`.

**Final Output**

The function `is_equal_to_sum_even(4)` returns `false`.

**Verification**

The result is correct because the input 4 is even but not greater than 7. The function correctly checks both conditions and returns the appropriate boolean value.

Assert Statement: assert (is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == false);
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of the provided IR code step by step.

**Understanding the Code**

The IR code defines a function named `is_equal_to_sum_even`. It takes an integer (`i32`) as input and returns a boolean value (`i1`) indicating whether the input is even and greater than 7.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

* **`%2 = and i32 %0, 1`**: This line performs a bitwise AND operation between the input (`%0`) and 1. This effectively checks if the least significant bit of the input is 0, which determines if the number is even.
* **`%3 = icmp eq i32 %2, 0`**: This line compares the result of the previous operation (`%2`) with 0. If `%2` is 0 (meaning the input was even), this will result in `true` (represented as 1 in LLVM IR).
* **`%4 = icmp sgt i32 %0, 7`**: This line compares the input (`%0`) with 7. If the input is greater than 7, this will result in `true` (1).
* **`%5 = and i1 %4, %3`**: This line performs a logical AND operation between the results of the previous two comparisons. The result will be `true` (1) only if both conditions are true: the input is even AND greater than 7.
* **`ret i1 %5`**: This line returns the final result (`%5`).

**Executing with Input 6**

Now, let's execute the code with the input `6`:

1. **`%2 = and i32 6, 1`**: 6 AND 1 = 0 (because the least significant bit of 6 is 0).
2. **`%3 = icmp eq i32 0, 0`**: 0 is equal to 0, so this results in `true` (1).
3. **`%4 = icmp sgt i32 6, 7`**: 6 is not greater than 7, so this results in `false` (0).
4. **`%5 = and i1 0, 1`**:  0 AND 1 = 0 (false).
5. **`ret i1 0`**: The function returns `false` (0).


**Verification**

The function correctly determined that 6 is even but not greater than 7, so the output `false` is correct.

**Final Output:**

```
false
```

Assert Statement: assert (is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == true);
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of the provided LLVM IR code step-by-step.

**Understanding the Code:**

The IR code defines a function named `is_equal_to_sum_even`. This function takes a single 32-bit integer (`i32`) as input and returns a boolean value (`i1`) indicating whether the input is greater than 7 and even.

**Step-by-Step Execution:**

1. **Input:** The input to the function is `8`.

2. **`%2 = and i32 %0, 1`:** This line performs a bitwise AND operation between the input (`%0`, which holds the value 8) and 1. The result is stored in `%2`.  Since 8 in binary is `1000`, and 1 in binary is `0001`, the AND operation results in `0000`, which is 0.

3. **`%3 = icmp eq i32 %2, 0`:** This line compares the value in `%2` (which is 0) with 0. Since they are equal, it sets `%3` to `true` (represented as 1 in LLVM IR).

4. **`%4 = icmp sgt i32 %0, 7`:** This line compares the input (`%0`, which is 8) with 7. Since 8 is greater than 7, it sets `%4` to `true` (1).

5. **`%5 = and i1 %4, %3`:** This line performs a logical AND operation between `%4` (true) and `%3` (true). Since both are true, `%5` is set to `true` (1).

6. **`ret i1 %5`:** The function returns the value in `%5`, which is `true`.

**Final Output:**

The function `is_equal_to_sum_even(8)` returns `true`.

**Verification:**

The result is correct because 8 is greater than 7 and is also even.

* `%4 = icmp sgt i32 %0, 7`: This line compares the input `%0` with the value 7. If the input is greater than 7, this comparison results in `true` (1).

* `%5 = and i1 %4, %3`: This line performs a logical AND operation between the results of the previous two comparisons (`%4` and `%3`). This means the final result will be `true` only if both conditions are met: the input is even AND greater than 7.

* `ret i1 %5`: This line returns the final boolean result (`%5`).

**Executing with Input 10**

Let's execute the code with the input value 10:

1. **Input:** `%0 = 10`

2. **`%2 = and i32 %0, 1`**: 10 AND 1 = 0 (10 is even)

3. **`%3 = icmp eq i32 %2, 0`**: 0 == 0, so `%3` is `true` (1)

4. **`%4 = icmp sgt i32 %0, 7`**: 10 > 7, so `%4` is `true` (1)

5. **`%5 = and i1 %4, %3`**: 1 AND 1 = 1, so `%5` is `true` (1)

6. **`ret i1 %5`**: The function returns `true`.

* **`ret i1 %5`:** This line returns the result of the logical AND operation (`%5`) as the output of the function.

**Execution with Input 11**

Now, let's execute the function with the input `11`:

1. **`%2 = and i32 11, 1`:** 11 in binary is 1011. Performing a bitwise AND with 1 (which is 0001 in binary) results in 1.

2. **`%3 = icmp eq i32 1, 0`:** Since `%2` is 1, the comparison with 0 returns `false` (0).

3. **`%4 = icmp sgt i32 11, 7`:** Since 11 is greater than 7, this comparison returns `true` (1).

4. **`%5 = and i1 1, 0`:** Performing a logical AND between `true` (1) and `false` (0) results in `false` (0).

5. **`ret i1 0`:** The function returns `false` (0).

Let me know if you'd like to analyze another input or explore a different IR code snippet!

Assert Statement: assert (is_equal_to_sum_even(13) == false);
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of the provided LLVM IR code step-by-step for the input `is_equal_to_sum_even(13)`.

**Understanding the Code**

The LLVM IR code defines a function named `is_equal_to_sum_even`. This function takes an integer (`i32`) as input and returns a boolean value (`i1`) indicating whether the input is greater than 7 and even.

**Step-by-Step Execution**

1. **Input:** The input to the function is `13`.

2. **`%2 = and i32 %0, 1`:** This line performs a bitwise AND operation between the input (`%0`, which is 13) and 1. In binary, 13 is `1101` and 1 is `0001`. The result of the AND operation is `0001`, which is 1. This checks if the least significant bit of the input is set (i.e., if the number is odd).

3. **`%3 = icmp eq i32 %2, 0`:** This line compares the result from the previous step (`%2`, which is 1) with 0. Since they are not equal, this comparison results in `false` (represented as `0` in LLVM IR).

4. **`%4 = icmp sgt i32 %0, 7`:** This line compares the input (`%0`, which is 13) with 7. Since 13 is greater than 7, this comparison results in `true` (represented as `1` in LLVM IR).

5. **`%5 = and i1 %4, %3`:** This line performs a bitwise AND operation between the results of the previous two comparisons (`%4`, which is `1`, and `%3`, which is `0`). Since one of the operands is `0`, the result is `0`, representing `false`.

6. **`ret i1 %5`:** The function returns the result of the last operation (`%5`), which is `false`.

**Final Output**

The function `is_equal_to_sum_even(13)` returns `false`.

**Verification**

The result is correct because 13 is not even, even though it is greater than 7. The function correctly implements the logic to check both conditions.



Let me know if you'd like to analyze another example or have any further questions!

Assert Statement: assert (is_equal_to_sum_even(16) == true);
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of this LLVM IR code step-by-step.

**Understanding the Code**

The provided IR code defines a function named `is_equal_to_sum_even`. This function takes a single 32-bit integer (`i32`) as input and returns a boolean value (`i1`) indicating whether the input is even and greater than 7.

Here's a line-by-line explanation:

* `b'; ModuleID = ...`: This is metadata about the source file.
* `define dso_local zeroext i1 @_Z20is_equal_to_sum_eveni(i32 %0) local_unnamed_addr #0 {`: This line defines the function signature:
    * `dso_local`:  Indicates the function has local scope.
    * `zeroext i1`: Specifies the return type as a 1-bit integer (boolean).
    * `@_Z20is_equal_to_sum_eveni`: This is the mangled name of the function.
    * `(i32 %0)`: The function takes one argument, a 32-bit integer named `%0`.
    * `local_unnamed_addr #0`: More metadata about the function.
* `%2 = and i32 %0, 1`: This line performs a bitwise AND operation between the input `%0` and 1. This effectively isolates the least significant bit of `%0`. If the least significant bit is 0, the number is even.
* `%3 = icmp eq i32 %2, 0`: This compares the result of the previous operation (`%2`) with 0. It sets `%3` to 1 (true) if `%2` is 0 (even) and 0 (false) otherwise.
* `%4 = icmp sgt i32 %0, 7`: This compares the input `%0` with 7, setting `%4` to 1 (true) if `%0` is greater than 7 and 0 (false) otherwise.
* `%5 = and i1 %4, %3`: This performs a bitwise AND between `%4` (greater than 7) and `%3` (even). The result, `%5`, will be 1 (true) only if both conditions are true.
* `ret i1 %5`: This line returns the final result, `%5`, which indicates whether the input is both even and greater than 7.

**Executing with Input 16**

Now let's execute the code with the input `16`:

1. **Input:** `%0 = 16`

2. **Line `%2 = and i32 %0, 1`:** 
   * `16` in binary is `10000`.
   * `1` in binary is `00001`.
   * `10000 AND 00001 = 00000`.
   * So, `%2 = 0`.

3. **Line `%3 = icmp eq i32 %2, 0`:**
   * `%2` is `0`, which is equal to `0`.
   * So, `%3 = 1` (true).

4. **Line `%4 = icmp sgt i32 %0, 7`:**
   * `16` is greater than `7`.
   * So, `%4 = 1` (true).

5. **Line `%5 = and i1 %4, %3`:**
   * Both `%4` and `%3` are `1` (true).
   * `1 AND 1 = 1`.
   * So, `%5 = 1` (true).

6. **Line `ret i1 %5`:**
   * The function returns `1` (true).

**Final Output:**

The function `is_equal_to_sum_even(16)` returns `true`.

**Verification:**

Our step-by-step execution matches the expected behavior of the code. The input `16` is both even and greater than 7, so the function correctly returns `true`.
