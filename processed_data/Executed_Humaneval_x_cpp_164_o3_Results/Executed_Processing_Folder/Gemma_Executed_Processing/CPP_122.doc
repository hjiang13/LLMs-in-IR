Assert Statement: assert (add_elements({1,-2,-3,41,57,76,87,88,99}, 3) == -4);
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of this IR code step-by-step.

**Understanding the Code**

This IR code implements a function called `add_elements`. It takes a vector of integers (`std::vector<int>`) and an integer (`i32`) as input. The function iterates through the vector, adds 99 to each element, and returns the sum of all the modified elements.

**Step-by-Step Execution**

Since we need to execute this code with the input `add_elements({1,-2,-3,41,57,76,87,88,99}, 3)`, let's focus on the relevant parts of the code.

1. **Input:**
   - `%0`: This represents the vector `{1,-2,-3,41,57,76,87,88,99}`.
   - `%1`: This represents the integer `3`.

2. **Initial Checks:**

   - The code first checks if `%1` (3) is greater than 0. It is, so the execution proceeds.

3. **Vector Access:**
   - `%5 = getelementptr inbounds %"class.std::vector", %"class.std::vector"* %0, i64 0, i32 0, i32 0, i32 0, i32 0`: This line retrieves a pointer to the beginning of the vector's data.

4. **Loop Setup:**
   - The code then enters a loop that iterates over the vector elements. The loop structure is optimized for performance using vector instructions.

5. **Vectorized Operations:**

   - The code uses SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions to process multiple elements of the vector simultaneously. For example, it loads four elements at a time into `<4 x i32>` registers.

6. **Adding 99:**
   - Inside the loop, each loaded set of four elements is added to 99.

7. **Conditional Accumulation:**
   -  The code checks if the result of adding 99 is less than 199. If it is, the element is added to an accumulator.

8. **Loop Termination:**

   - The loop continues until all elements of the vector have been processed.

9. **Final Reduction:**
   - After the loop, the accumulated values are added together to get the final sum.

10. **Return Value:**

   - The final sum is returned as the result of the `add_elements` function.

**Calculating the Result**

Given the input vector `{1,-2,-3,41,57,76,87,88,99}` and the integer 3, the function will perform the following:

1. Add 99 to each element of the vector.
2. Sum the modified elements.

The final result will be the sum of the modified elements.

**Important Notes:**

- The actual calculations involve vector instructions and SIMD operations, which are optimized for performance.
- The code is designed to handle vectors of various sizes efficiently.

Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific part of the code or the execution process.

Assert Statement: assert (add_elements({111,121,3,4000,5,6}, 2) == 0);
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of this IR code step by step.

**Understanding the Function**

The IR code defines a function named `add_elements`. This function takes a vector of integers (`std::vector<int>`) and an integer (`int`) as input. It iterates through the vector, adds 99 to each element, and then sums up all the modified elements.

**Input:**

The assert statement provides us with the input:

*  `{111, 121, 3, 4000, 5, 6}` (The vector)
*  `2` (The integer)

**Step-by-Step Execution**

1. **Initialization:**

   * The function starts by checking if the input integer (`2` in our case) is greater than 0. Since it is, the code proceeds.

2. **Vector Access:**

   * The code retrieves a pointer to the beginning of the vector data.

3. **Looping:**

   * The code enters a loop that iterates through the vector. 
   *  It checks if the number of elements to process (`2`) is less than 8. Since it's less than 8, it takes a specific branch.

4. **Vectorized Operations:**

   * The code uses vector instructions to process multiple elements simultaneously. It loads 4 integers at a time from the vector, adds 99 to each, and checks if the result is less than 199. If it is, the modified value is accumulated.

5. **Remainder Handling:**

   * After processing multiples of 4 elements, the code handles any remaining elements individually.

6. **Summation:**

   * The code sums up all the accumulated values from the vectorized and individual element processing.

7. **Return:**

   * The function returns the final sum.

**Output:**

The result of executing this code with the given input will be the sum of the modified elements in the vector.

**Verification:**

To verify the correctness, you would need to manually perform the following:

1. Add 99 to each element in the vector: `{210, 220, 102, 4099, 104, 105}`.
2. Sum up all the elements: 210 + 220 + 102 + 4099 + 104 + 105 = **4640**.

**Therefore, the expected output of the function `add_elements({111, 121, 3, 4000, 5, 6}, 2)` should be 4640.**

Assert Statement: assert (add_elements({11,21,3,90,5,6,7,8,9}, 4) == 125);
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of this IR code step by step.

**Understanding the Code**

This IR code implements a function called `add_elements` that takes a vector of integers (`std::vector<int>`) and an integer (`i32`) as input. It iterates through the vector, adds a constant value (99) to each element, and returns the sum of all the modified elements.

**Step-by-Step Execution**

1. **Function Entry:**

   - We start at the beginning of the `add_elements` function.
   - The input vector is passed in as `%0` and the integer value is passed in as `%1`.

2. **Initial Check:**

   - The code first checks if the integer value (`%1`) is greater than 0.

   ```assembly
   %3 = icmp sgt i32 %1, 0
   br i1 %3, label %4, label %86
   ```

   - If `%1` is not greater than 0, it jumps to the end of the function (`label %86`), effectively returning 0.

3. **Vector Access:**

   - If `%1` is greater than 0, the code proceeds to access the data within the vector.

   ```assembly
   %5 = getelementptr inbounds %"class.std::vector", %"class.std::vector"* %0, i64 0, i32 0, i32 0, i32 0, i32 0
   %6 = load i32*, i32** %5, align 8, !tbaa !3
   ```

   - `%5` calculates the address of the beginning of the vector's data.
   - `%6` loads a pointer to the first element of the vector.

4. **Loop Setup:**

   - The code then enters a loop to iterate through the vector.

   ```assembly
   %7 = zext i32 %1 to i64
   %8 = icmp ult i32 %1, 8
   br i1 %8, label %83, label %9
   ```

   - `%7` converts `%1` (the integer value) to a 64-bit integer.
   - `%8` checks if `%1` is less than 8.

5. **Small Vector Optimization:**

   - If `%1` is less than 8, a different loop (`label %83`) is used, likely optimized for smaller vectors.

6. **Large Vector Loop:**

   - If `%1` is 8 or greater, the main loop (`label %9`) is executed. This loop uses vector instructions to process multiple elements at a time.

   - The loop iterates through the vector in chunks of 4 elements. It adds 99 to each element, checks if the result is less than 199, and accumulates the sum.

7. **Loop Exit and Sum Calculation:**

   - After the loop completes, the accumulated sum is calculated and returned.

**Applying the Input**

For the input `add_elements({11,21,3,90,5,6,7,8,9}, 4)`, the code would:

1. Iterate through the first 4 elements of the vector (11, 21, 3, 90).
2. Add 99 to each element.
3. Accumulate the sum of the modified elements.

The final sum would be returned.

**Verification**



Let me know if you'd like me to walk through the execution with a specific input vector and value, or if you have any other questions about the code!

Assert Statement: assert (add_elements({111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9}, 4) == 24);
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of this IR code step by step.

**Understanding the Code**

This IR code represents a function named `add_elements` that takes a vector of integers (`std::vector<int>`) and an integer (`i32`) as input. It adds a constant value (99) to each element of the vector and then sums up all the elements.

**Step-by-Step Execution**

We'll use the input provided in the assertion:

```
assert (add_elements({111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9}, 4) == 24);
```

1. **Initialization:**

   - The function receives a vector containing the elements: {111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
   - The integer input is 4.

2. **Check for Empty Vector:**

   - The code first checks if the input integer (`i1`) is greater than 0. Since it is 4, the code proceeds.

3. **Vector Access:**

   - The code retrieves the pointer to the beginning of the vector data (`%6`).

4. **Looping through the Vector:**

   - The code enters a loop that iterates through the vector elements.
   - It checks if the number of elements to process (`i1`) is less than 8. Since it's 4, it enters a specialized loop for smaller vectors.

5. **Processing Elements:**

   - Inside the loop, the code loads four elements at a time from the vector into SIMD registers (`<4 x i32>`).
   - It adds 99 to each element in these registers.
   - It checks if the resulting values are less than 199 (likely to prevent overflow).
   - If the values are less than 199, it accumulates the sum in separate SIMD registers.

6. **Handling Remaining Elements:**

   - After processing elements in groups of four, the code checks for any remaining elements.
   - If there are remaining elements, it processes them individually, adding 99 and accumulating the sum.

7. **Final Summation:**

   - The code combines the sums from the SIMD registers and any remaining elements to get the total sum.

8. **Return Value:**

   - The function returns the final sum.

**Verification**

- The expected output is 24.

- Let's manually verify the calculation:
   - The first four elements of the vector are {111, 21, 3, 4000}.

   - Adding 99 to each: {210, 120, 102, 4099}.

   - The sum of these elements is 4511.

**Discrepancy:**

- There seems to be a discrepancy between the expected output (24) and the actual calculation result (4511).

- This indicates a potential error in either the assertion statement or the code itself.


Let me know if you'd like me to investigate further or explore other aspects of the IR code.

Assert Statement: assert (add_elements({1}, 1) == 1);
Execution Result:
Let's break down the execution of the provided IR code step-by-step, keeping in mind the assertion `assert (add_elements({1}, 1) == 1);`.

**Understanding the Code**

The IR code defines a function `add_elements` that takes a vector of integers (`std::vector<int>`) and an integer as input. It iterates over the vector, adds 99 to each element, and returns the sum of all modified elements.

**Step-by-Step Execution**

1. **Initialization:**

   - We are calling `add_elements({1}, 1)`. This means the input vector contains a single element, `1`, and the integer argument is also `1`.

2. **Function Entry:**

   - Execution starts at the beginning of the `add_elements` function.

3. **Input Check:**

   - The code first checks if the integer argument (`1` in our case) is greater than 0. Since it is, we proceed.

4. **Vector Access:**

   - The code retrieves a pointer to the beginning of the input vector's data using `%6 = load i32*, i32** %5, align 8`.

5. **Loop Setup:**

   - The code prepares for a loop to iterate through the vector elements.

6. **Loop Condition:**

   - The loop condition checks if we've processed all elements. In our case, since the vector has only one element, the loop will run once.

7. **Element Access and Modification:**

   - Inside the loop, the code loads the first element (`1`) from the vector, adds 99 to it (resulting in 100), and then performs a comparison to check if the modified value is less than 199.

8. **Sum Calculation:**

   - Since the modified value (100) is less than 199, it's added to a running sum.

9. **Loop Exit:**

   - The loop completes after processing the single element.

10. **Return Value:**

    - The function returns the calculated sum.

**Verification**

- The sum calculated by the function will be `100`.

- The assertion `assert (add_elements({1}, 1) == 1);` will **fail** because the expected result is `1`, but the function returns `100`.
