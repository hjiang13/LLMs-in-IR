Step 1: The function signature indicates that it returns an `i1` type (1-bit integer) and takes a reference to a `basic_string` as an argument.

Step 2: The function starts by checking if the length of the input string is less than 2. In this case, "go" has a length of 2, so the condition is false, and we proceed to the next step.

Step 3: The function then checks if the length of the input string is less than 4. Since the length of "go" is 2, this condition is also false, and we proceed to the next step.

Step 4: Inside the next block, a phi node is used to choose between the value 2 and the value from the previous iteration. Initially, the value is set to 2.

Step 5: The function calculates the remainder of the string length divided by the current value (which is 2 initially). In this case, the remainder of 2 divided by 2 is 0.

  - The function is defined to return a zero-extended integer (i1) value.

Step 2: Function Definition
  - The function definition involves several intermediate steps to calculate the prime length of the input string.
  - It includes loading the length of the string and performing arithmetic operations to check for prime length conditions.

Step 3: Load String Length
  - The length of the input string is loaded into a register (%4) after fetching it from the input parameter using a getelementptr instruction.

Step 4: Check for Length Less Than 2
  - The first comparison checks if the length of the string is less than 2.
  - If true, it directly returns false as the length cannot be prime.

Step 5: Check for Length Less Than 4
  - If the length is not less than 2, it proceeds to the next comparison to check if the length is less than 4.
  - If true, it also returns false as the length cannot be prime.

Step 6: Prime Length Calculation
  - If the length is greater than or equal to 4, it calculates the prime length by iteratively checking for prime conditions.
  - It uses a loop to increment a counter and check if the square of the counter exceeds the length.

Step 7: Return and Phi Node
  - Depending on the conditions met during the loop, the function returns either true or false as the prime length result.
  - Phi nodes are used to track the values of the counter variable during loop iterations.

Step 8: Final Return
  - The final output is determined based on the calculated conditions and returned as the function result.

Final Output:
- For the input parameter "0", the function returns false as the length is not prime.
