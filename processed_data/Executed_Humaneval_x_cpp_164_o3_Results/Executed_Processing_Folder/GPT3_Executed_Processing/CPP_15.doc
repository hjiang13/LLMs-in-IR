Assert Statement: assert (string_sequence(0) == "0");
Execution Result:
Step 1: Parse the IR code to understand the provided functions and data structures.
  The IR code includes type definitions, function definitions, and declarations.

Step 2: Identify the function "_Z15string_sequenceB5cxx11i" in the IR code.
  - The function takes a reference to a string object and an integer as input.
  - It performs string manipulation operations within the function.

Step 3: Analyze the function implementation to understand the string manipulation logic.
  - The function involves appending characters to the string based on the input integer value.
  - It uses various function calls and memory operations to manipulate the string.

Step 4: Execute the function "_Z15string_sequenceB5cxx11i" with input value 0.
  - Initialize the string object.
  - Call the function with the initialized string object and input value 0.

Step 5: Trace the execution of the function step by step.
  - Follow the function logic to append characters to the string based on the input value.

Step 6: Final Output Analysis.
  - Check the final content of the string object after function execution with input 0.

Final Output:
The function "_Z15string_sequenceB5cxx11i" manipulates the string object based on the input value and appends characters accordingly. The final string content after executing the function with input 0 should be "0".

Verification:
The correctness of the result can be verified by confirming that the string object contains the expected value "0" after executing the function with input 0.

Overall, the function should correctly manipulate the string object according to the specified logic and produce the expected output "0".

Assert Statement: assert (string_sequence(3) == "0 1 2 3");
Execution Result:
Step 1: The IR code defines a function `_Z15string_sequenceB5cxx11i` that takes an integer parameter.
         The function implementation involves various memory operations and string manipulations.
Step 2: The function `_Z15string_sequenceB5cxx11i` initializes some variables and allocates memory for strings.
Step 3: The function then checks if the input integer is less than 1, and if so, branches to label 170.
Step 4: If the input integer is not less than 1, the function goes to label 36.
Step 5: At label 36, the function creates a new basic string object and populates it with characters based on the input integer and other values.
Step 6: It then performs various memory and string manipulation operations based on the input integer and strings.
Step 7: The function continues with branching and string manipulation until it reaches the end, where it returns void.
Final Output: The function `_Z15string_sequenceB5cxx11i` performs various string manipulations and memory operations based on the input integer.
Verification: The function execution is complex, involving multiple memory operations and string manipulations, making it challenging to provide a direct output without detailed tracking of memory and string content changes. The final output would depend on the specific input integer provided to the function.

Assert Statement: assert (string_sequence(10) == "0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10");
Execution Result:
Step 1: Parse the provided IR code snippet to understand the structure and types defined.
  - The IR code snippet defines various types, structs, constants, and functions related to string manipulation using C++.
Step 2: Identify the function `_Z15string_sequenceB5cxx11i` that we need to execute.
  - This function takes an integer parameter and performs string manipulation operations.
Step 3: Analyze the function execution logic step by step.
  - The function involves memory allocation, string manipulation, and error handling.
  - It appends numbers to a string based on the input integer.
  - It also handles potential errors, such as throwing a length error if the string length exceeds a certain limit.
Step 4: Execute the function `_Z15string_sequenceB5cxx11i` with the input `10`.
  - The function will generate a string containing numbers from `0` to `10` separated by spaces.
Step 5: Verify the output of the function for the input `10`.
  - The expected output is `"0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"`.
Step 6: Validate the correctness of the output against the expected result.
  - If the function executes correctly, the output should match the expected string.
