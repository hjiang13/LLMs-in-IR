Assert Statement: assert (car_race_collision(10) == 100);
Execution Result:
Step-by-Step Reasoning:
Step 1: Parse the IR Code
The IR code defines a function named car_race_collision that takes an integer argument and returns an integer result.
Step 2: Identify the Function Call
The assert statement is calling the function car_race_collision with an argument of 10 and expecting the result to be 100.
Step 3: Execute the Function
- The function takes an integer argument %0.
- It multiplies the argument by itself: %2 = %0 * %0.
