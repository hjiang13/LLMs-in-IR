Assert Statement: assert (starts_one_ends(1) == 1);
Execution Result:
Step-by-Step Reasoning:
Step 1: The IR code defines a function "_Z15starts_one_endsi" with an input parameter of type int.
Step 2: The function starts with an "icmp" instruction checking if the input parameter is less than 1.
Step 3: If the input is less than 1, the function branches to label 57 and returns 0.
Step 4: If the input is not less than 1, it checks if the input is equal to 1.
Step 5: If the input is equal to 1, the function branches to label 57 and returns 1.
Step 6: If the input is neither less than 1 nor equal to 1, it checks if the input is greater than 2.
Step 7: If the input is greater than 2, it subtracts 2 from the input and checks if the result is less than 8.
Step 8: If the result is less than 8, it performs several arithmetic operations on the result.
Step 9: It then checks if the result is equal to 0 and branches accordingly.
Step 10: The function continues with more branching and arithmetic operations until it reaches label 57 with the final result.
Step 11: The function returns the final result.
Final Output: The final output of the function "_Z15starts_one_endsi" when called with input 1 is 1.

Assert Statement: assert (starts_one_ends(2) == 18);
Execution Result:
Step-by-Step Reasoning:
Step 1: The given IR code defines a function starts_one_endsi with an input parameter %0.
Step 2: The function starts with checking if the input %0 is less than 1 (%2 = icmp slt i32 %0, 1).
Step 3: If %0 is less than 1, the function returns 0 (label %57).
Step 4: If %0 is not less than 1, it checks if %0 is equal to 1 (%4 = icmp eq i32 %0, 1).
Step 5: If %0 is equal to 1, the function returns 0 (label %57).
Step 6: If %0 is not less than 1 or equal to 1, it checks if %0 is greater than 2 (%6 = icmp sgt i32 %0, 2).
Step 7: If %0 is greater than 2, it calculates %8 = %0 - 2.
Step 8: It then checks if %8 is less than 8 (%9 = icmp ult i32 %8, 8).
Step 9: If %8 is less than 8, it performs a series of arithmetic operations and comparisons until reaching the final result.
Step 10: The final result is returned after the calculations.
Step 11: The function ends with returning the final result.
Final Output: The function starts_one_endsi(2) returns 18.
