- Calculate `%8` as the product of `%7` and `%1` (12).
- Increment `%6` by 1 to get `%9`.
- Check if `%8` is less than or equal to `%0` (1).
- Check if `%6` is less than 99.
- Calculate `%12` based on the comparisons.
- Calculate `%13` as the logical XOR of `%12` and true.
- Check if `%8` is equal to `%0`.
- Calculate `%15` based on `%13` and `%14`.
- Branch based on `%15`.
Step 6: Branch back to Label 5 or 16
Depending on the result of `%15`, branch back to label 5 or 16.
Step 7: Execute Instructions at Label 16
- Calculate `%17` using a phi node that depends on the previous values at label 5 or 2.
- Return the result `%17`.
Step 8: Obtain the Final Result
The final result of invoking `_Z15is_simple_powerii(1, 12)` is stored in `%17`.
Step 9: Verify the Result
Based on the logic and comparisons in the function, the expected result should be true.
