Step 1: Function Definition
  The given IR code defines a function named `_Z4modpii` with two integer parameters.
Step 2: Check Parameter Conditions
  The first parameter `%0` is compared to 0 using `icmp sgt`. If `%0` is greater than 0, it proceeds to label 4, otherwise goes to label 21.
Step 3: Branching to Label 4

  If `%5` is less than 3, it goes to label 10, otherwise goes to label 8.
Step 5: Branching to Label 10
  At label 10, it calculates a `phi` node based on the incoming values from labels 4 and 23.
  It performs some arithmetic operations and checks a condition to either go to label 21 or loop back to label 14.
Step 6: Returning the Result
  At label 21, it calculates another `phi` node based on various incoming values and returns the final result.
Step 7: Checking Loop Condition
  If the condition at label 10 is false, it goes back to label 23 to continue the loop until the loop condition is met.
