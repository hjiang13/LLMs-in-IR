assert (fib4(5) == 4);,fail,"To analyze whether the assertion passes or fails, we need to understand the logic of the `fib4` function.

The `fib4` function takes an integer argument `n` and returns the `n`-th Fibonacci number. The function uses a loop to calculate the Fibonacci number, and it uses an array `arr` to store the previous Fibonacci numbers.

The function starts by initializing the first two elements of the array `arr` to 0 and 1, respectively. Then, it loops from 2 to `n` and calculates the `i`-th Fibonacci number using the formula `arr[i] = arr[i-1] + arr[i-2]`. Finally, the function returns the `n`-th Fibonacci number, which is stored in `arr[n]`.

Now, let's analyze the assertion statement `assert (fib4(5) == 4);`. We can see that the function `fib4` is called with the argument `5`, and the assertion checks whether the return value of the function is equal to `4`.

To determine whether the assertion passes or fails, we need to calculate the value of `fib4(5)`. We can do this by following the logic of the function:

1. Initialize the first two elements of the array `arr` to 0 and 1, respectively.
2. Loop from 2 to `n` and calculate the `i`-th Fibonacci number using the formula `arr[i] = arr[i-1] + arr[i-2]`.
3. Return the `n`-th Fibonacci number, which is stored in `arr[n]`.

Using this logic, we can calculate the value of `fib4(5)` as follows:

1. Initialize the first two elements of the array `arr` to 0 and 1, respectively.
2. Loop from 2 to 5 and calculate the `i`-th Fibonacci number using the formula `arr[i] = arr[i-1] + arr[i-2]`.
3. Return the 5-th Fibonacci number, which is stored in `arr[5]`.

The value of `fib4(5)` is 5, which is not equal to 4. Therefore, the assertion fails.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **fail**"
assert (fib4(8) == 28);,unknown,"To analyze whether the assertion passes or fails, we need to understand the logic of the `fib4` function. The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`-th Fibonacci number.

The function uses a loop to calculate the Fibonacci number. The loop starts from `n-1` and iterates until `n`. Inside the loop, the function uses a temporary array `arr` to store the previous two Fibonacci numbers. The function then calculates the current Fibonacci number by adding the previous two numbers.

Based on the logic of the function, we can see that the assertion `fib4(8) == 28` should pass. The 8-th Fibonacci number is indeed 28.

Therefore, the final result of the assertion is **pass**."
assert (fib4(10) == 104);,fail,"To analyze whether the assertion passes or fails, we need to understand the logic of the `fib4` function.

The `fib4` function takes an integer argument `n` and returns the `n`-th Fibonacci number. The function uses a loop to calculate the Fibonacci number recursively.

The assertion statement `assert (fib4(10) == 104);` checks whether the 10th Fibonacci number is equal to 104.

To determine the pass/fail result of the assertion, we need to evaluate the expression `fib4(10)`.

The `fib4` function can be broken down into three parts:

1. The first part initializes the array `a` with the first four Fibonacci numbers: 0, 1, 1, and 2.
2. The second part calculates the remaining Fibonacci numbers using a loop. The loop starts from `i = 4` and ends when `i` reaches `n`.
3. The third part returns the `n`-th Fibonacci number.

To evaluate `fib4(10)`, we need to execute the loop from `i = 4` to `i = 10`. The loop calculates the Fibonacci numbers as follows:

* `a[4] = a[2] + a[3] = 1 + 1 = 2`
* `a[5] = a[3] + a[4] = 1 + 2 = 3`
* `a[6] = a[4] + a[5] = 2 + 3 = 5`
* `a[7] = a[5] + a[6] = 3 + 5 = 8`
* `a[8] = a[6] + a[7] = 5 + 8 = 13`
* `a[9] = a[7] + a[8] = 8 + 13 = 21`
* `a[10] = a[8] + a[9] = 13 + 21 = 34`

Therefore, `fib4(10)` returns 34, which is not equal to 104.

Based on the above analysis, the assertion statement `assert (fib4(10) == 104);` fails.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **fail**"
assert (fib4(12) == 386);,pass,"To analyze whether the assertion passes or fails, we need to understand the logic of the `fib4` function. The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`-th Fibonacci number.

The function uses a loop to calculate the Fibonacci number. The loop starts from `n-1` and goes up to `n`. Inside the loop, the function uses a temporary array `arr` to store the previous two Fibonacci numbers. The function then calculates the current Fibonacci number by adding the previous two numbers.

The function returns the last Fibonacci number calculated, which is the `n`-th Fibonacci number.

Now, let's analyze the assertion statement:
```
assert (fib4(12) == 386);
```
The assertion statement checks if the result of `fib4(12)` is equal to `386`. To evaluate this expression, we need to call the `fib4` function with the input `12`.

The `fib4` function will calculate the 12-th Fibonacci number, which is `386`. Therefore, the assertion statement will pass.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
