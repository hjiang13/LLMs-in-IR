assert (sum_to_n(1) == 1);,pass,"To analyze whether the assertion passes or fails, we need to understand the semantics of the function `sum_to_n`. The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of all integers from 1 to `n`.

Based on the LLVM IR code, we can see that the function is defined as follows:
```
define dso_local i32 @_Z8sum_to_ni(i32 %0) local_unnamed_addr #0 {
  %2 = add nsw i32 %0, 1
  %3 = mul nsw i32 %2, %0
  %4 = sdiv i32 %3, 2
  ret i32 %4
}
```
The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of all integers from 1 to `n`. The function is defined using the `add`, `mul`, and `sdiv` instructions, which are all integer arithmetic instructions.

Now, let's analyze the assertion statement:
```
assert (sum_to_n(1) == 1);
```
The assertion statement is checking whether the result of calling `sum_to_n` with the argument `1` is equal to `1`.

To evaluate the assertion, we need to understand the semantics of the `sum_to_n` function. As we mentioned earlier, the function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of all integers from 1 to `n`. Therefore, when we call `sum_to_n` with the argument `1`, the function will return the sum of all integers from 1 to 1, which is simply 1.

Therefore, the assertion statement is equivalent to:
```
assert (1 == 1);
```
This assertion statement is clearly true, so the final result of the assertion is **pass**.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (sum_to_n(6) == 21);,pass,"To analyze whether the assertion passes or fails, we need to understand the semantics of the function `sum_to_n` and the input value `6`.

From the LLVM IR code, we can see that `sum_to_n` is a function that takes an integer argument `n` and returns an integer value. The function body consists of three instructions:

1. `%2 = add nsw i32 %0, 1`: This instruction adds 1 to the input value `n` and stores the result in register `%2`.
2. `%3 = mul nsw i32 %2, %0`: This instruction multiplies the result of the previous instruction (i.e., `n + 1`) by the input value `n` and stores the result in register `%3`.
3. `%4 = sdiv i32 %3, 2`: This instruction divides the result of the previous instruction (i.e., `n * (n + 1)`) by 2 and stores the result in register `%4`.

Therefore, the return value of `sum_to_n` is `n * (n + 1) / 2`.

Now, let's analyze the assertion statement:

`assert (sum_to_n(6) == 21);`

We know that `sum_to_n(6)` returns `6 * (6 + 1) / 2`, which is equal to `21`. Therefore, the assertion passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (sum_to_n(11) == 66);,pass,"To analyze whether the assertion passes or fails, we need to evaluate the expression `sum_to_n(11) == 66`.

1. First, we need to understand what the `sum_to_n` function does. The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of all integers from 1 to `n`.
2. Next, we need to evaluate the expression `sum_to_n(11) == 66`. We can do this by substituting the value of `n` (11) into the function and evaluating the expression.
3. The function `sum_to_n` can be evaluated as follows:
```
sum_to_n(11) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11
             = 66
```
4. Therefore, the expression `sum_to_n(11) == 66` evaluates to `true`.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (sum_to_n(30) == 465);,unknown,"To analyze whether the assertion passes or fails, we need to understand the logic of the `sum_to_n` function. The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of all integers from 1 to `n`.

Based on the LLVM IR code, we can see that the `sum_to_n` function is defined as follows:
```
define dso_local i32 @_Z8sum_to_ni(i32 %0) local_unnamed_addr #0 {

  %3 = mul nsw i32 %2, %0
  %4 = sdiv i32 %3, 2
  ret i32 %4
}
```
The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of all integers from 1 to `n`. The function first adds 1 to `n`, then multiplies the result by `n`, and finally divides the result by 2.

Now, let's analyze the assertion statement:
```
assert (sum_to_n(30) == 465);
```
The assertion statement checks whether the result of `sum_to_n(30)` is equal to 465. To evaluate the assertion, we need to substitute the value of `n` in the `sum_to_n` function with 30 and evaluate the function.

Substituting `n` with 30 in the `sum_to_n` function, we get:
```
sum_to_n(30) = (30 + 1) * 30 / 2 = 915
```
Since 915 is not equal to 465, the assertion fails.

Therefore, the final result of the assertion is **fail**."
assert (sum_to_n(100) == 5050);,pass,"To analyze whether the assertion passes or fails, we need to understand the logic of the function `sum_to_n`. The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of all integers from 1 to `n`.

The LLVM IR code for the function is as follows:

  %3 = mul nsw i32 %2, %0
  %4 = sdiv i32 %3, 2
  ret i32 %4
}
```
The function starts by adding 1 to the input `n` and storing the result in `%2`. Then, it multiplies `%2` by `n` and stores the result in `%3`. Finally, it divides `%3` by 2 and returns the result as the sum of all integers from 1 to `n`.

Now, let's analyze the assertion statement:
```
assert (sum_to_n(100) == 5050);
```
The assertion statement is checking whether the result of `sum_to_n(100)` is equal to 5050. To evaluate this expression, we need to substitute the value of `n` in the function definition with 100.

So, the expression `sum_to_n(100)` becomes:
```
sum_to_n(100) = (100 + 1) * 100 / 2 = 5050
```
Therefore, the assertion statement is true, and the result of `sum_to_n(100)` is indeed equal to 5050.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
