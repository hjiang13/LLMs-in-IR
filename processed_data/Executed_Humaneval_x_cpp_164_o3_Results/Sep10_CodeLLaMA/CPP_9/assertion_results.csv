"assert (issame(rolling_max({}),{}));",pass,"To analyze whether the assertion statement passes or fails, we need to understand the semantics of the `rolling_max` function and the `issame` function.

The `rolling_max` function takes a vector of integers as input and returns a new vector of integers where each element is the maximum of the previous `k` elements in the input vector. The `k` value is determined by the size of the input vector.

The `issame` function takes two vectors as input and returns `true` if they have the same elements in the same order, and `false` otherwise.

Based on this information, we can analyze the assertion statement as follows:

* `rolling_max({})` returns an empty vector, which is the same as `{}`.
* `issame({}, {})` returns `true`.

Therefore, the assertion statement `assert (issame(rolling_max({}),{}));` passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(rolling_max({1, 2, 3, 4}) , {1, 2, 3, 4}));",pass,"To analyze whether the assertion statement passes or fails, we need to understand the semantics of the `rolling_max` function.

The `rolling_max` function takes a vector of integers as input and returns a new vector where each element is the maximum of the corresponding element and all previous elements in the input vector.

For example, if the input vector is `{1, 2, 3, 4}`, the output vector would be `{1, 2, 3, 4}`. If the input vector is `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`, the output vector would be `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`.

With this understanding, let's analyze the assertion statement:

`assert (issame(rolling_max({1, 2, 3, 4}) , {1, 2, 3, 4}));`

The `issame` function checks if two vectors are identical, element-wise. In this case, we are checking if the output vector from `rolling_max({1, 2, 3, 4})` is identical to the input vector `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.

Since the output vector from `rolling_max({1, 2, 3, 4})` is `{1, 2, 3, 4}`, which is identical to the input vector, the assertion statement passes.

Therefore, the final result is:

**assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(rolling_max({4, 3, 2, 1}),{4, 4, 4, 4}));",unknown,"To analyze whether the assertion passes or fails, we need to understand the logic of the `rolling_max` function.

The `rolling_max` function takes a vector of integers as input and returns a new vector where each element is the maximum of the current element and all previous elements.

For example, if the input vector is `{4, 3, 2, 1}`, the output vector would be `{4, 4, 4, 4}`.

Now, let's analyze the assertion statement:
```
assert (issame(rolling_max({4, 3, 2, 1}),{4, 4, 4, 4}));
```
The `issame` function checks if two vectors are identical, element-wise. In this case, we are checking if the output vector from `rolling_max({4, 3, 2, 1})` is identical to `{4, 4, 4, 4}`.

To determine the pass/fail result of the assertion, we need to evaluate the `rolling_max` function with the input vector `{4, 3, 2, 1}`.

The `rolling_max` function is implemented using a loop that iterates over the input vector and calculates the maximum of each element and all previous elements. The output vector is then constructed by appending the maximum value to the output vector at each iteration.

Therefore, the output vector from `rolling_max({4, 3, 2, 1})` would be `{4, 4, 4, 4}`.

Now, we can compare the output vector with the expected output vector `{4, 4, 4, 4}`. Since they are identical, the assertion passes.

**final result**: **pass**"

Therefore, the final result is:
