assert (prime_fib(1) == 2);,pass,"To analyze whether the assertion passes or fails, we need to understand the logic of the `prime_fib` function. The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`-th prime number in the Fibonacci sequence.

The function starts by initializing three variables: `a`, `b`, and `c`. `a` and `b` are set to 1 and 2, respectively, while `c` is set to 0. The function then enters a loop where it checks if `c` is less than `n`. If it is, the function updates `a`, `b`, and `c` based on the Fibonacci sequence and repeats the loop. If `c` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns `b`.

Now, let's analyze the assertion statement:
```
assert (prime_fib(1) == 2);
```
The assertion checks if the result of calling `prime_fib` with the input `1` is equal to `2`. To determine the result of the assertion, we need to understand the logic of the `prime_fib` function.

The function starts by initializing `a` and `b` to 1 and 2, respectively. Since `c` is initialized to 0, the loop condition is initially true, and the loop is entered.

In the first iteration of the loop, `a` and `b` are updated based on the Fibonacci sequence: `a` is set to 1, and `b` is set to 2. `c` is also updated to 1.

In the second iteration of the loop, `a` and `b` are updated again based on the Fibonacci sequence: `a` is set to 2, and `b` is set to 3. `c` is also updated to 2.

Since `c` is now greater than or equal to `n` (which is 1), the function returns `b`, which is 2.

Therefore, the assertion passes, and the result of the assertion is **pass**.

The assertion `assert (prime_fib(2) == 3);` checks if the 2nd prime number in the Fibonacci sequence is equal to 3. To determine the result of the assertion, we need to evaluate the expression `prime_fib(2)`.

To do this, we can trace the execution of the `prime_fib` function with `n = 2`. The function starts by initializing `a = 1`, `b = 2`, and `c = 0`. Since `c` is less than `n`, the function updates `a` and `b` and increments `c`. The updated values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are `a = 2`, `b = 3`, and `c = 1`.

Since `c` is still less than `n`, the function updates `a` and `b` again and increments `c`. The updated values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are `a = 3`, `b = 5`, and `c = 2`.

Since `c` is now greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns `b`, which is 5. Therefore, the result of the assertion `assert (prime_fib(2) == 3);` is **fail**.

assert (prime_fib(3) == 5);,pass,"To analyze whether the assertion passes or fails, we need to understand the logic of the `prime_fib` function. The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`-th prime number in the Fibonacci sequence.

The function starts by initializing two variables, `a` and `b`, to 1 and 2, respectively. It then enters a loop where it checks if `a` is less than `n`. If it is, it adds `a` and `b` and updates `a` and `b` to the new values. If `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, it returns `a`.

The function also includes a check to ensure that the result is a prime number. It does this by checking if the result is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the result. If it is, the function returns 0.

With this understanding, we can analyze the assertion statement. The assertion states that `prime_fib(3) == 5`. To evaluate this assertion, we need to determine what `prime_fib(3)` returns.

We can see from the function definition that `prime_fib(3)` will return the 3rd prime number in the Fibonacci sequence. The first two prime numbers in the sequence are 2 and 3, so `prime_fib(3)` will return 5.

Therefore, the assertion statement is true, and the result of the assertion is **pass**.

To determine whether the assertion passes or fails, we need to evaluate the expression `prime_fib(4) == 13`. We can do this by stepping through the function's logic:

1. `a` is set to 1, `b` is set to 2, and `c` is set to 0.
2. `c` is less than `n` (4), so the function updates `a` and `b` using the recurrence relation and increments `c` by 1.
3. `c` is less than `n` (4), so the function updates `a` and `b` using the recurrence relation and increments `c` by 1.
4. `c` is greater than or equal to `n` (4), so the function returns `b`.

Therefore, `prime_fib(4)` returns 13, which means the assertion passes.

The function starts by initializing `a = 1`, `b = 2`, and `c = 0`. It then enters the loop and checks if `c` is less than `n`. Since `c` is less than `n`, the function updates `a` and `b` using the recurrence relation and increments `c` by 1. It then repeats this process until `c` is greater than or equal to `n`.

After 5 iterations, `a` is equal to 89 and `b` is equal to 144. Since `a` is equal to 89, the function returns `a`, which is equal to 89. Therefore, the assertion `assert (prime_fib(5) == 89)` passes.

The assertion statement `assert (prime_fib(6) == 233);` checks if the 6-th prime number in the Fibonacci sequence is equal to 233. To determine the pass/fail result of this assertion, we need to understand the logic of the `prime_fib` function and the values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` at each iteration of the loop.

Here is the analysis of the `prime_fib` function:

1. Initialization: `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `c = 0`
2. Iteration 1: `c` is less than `n`, so `a = b + c` and `b = a + c`. `a` becomes 3, `b` becomes 5, and `c` becomes 1.
3. Iteration 2: `c` is less than `n`, so `a = b + c` and `b = a + c`. `a` becomes 8, `b` becomes 13, and `c` becomes 2.
4. Iteration 3: `c` is less than `n`, so `a = b + c` and `b = a + c`. `a` becomes 21, `b` becomes 34, and `c` becomes 3.
5. Iteration 4: `c` is less than `n`, so `a = b + c` and `b = a + c`. `a` becomes 55, `b` becomes 89, and `c` becomes 5.
6. Iteration 5: `c` is less than `n`, so `a = b + c` and `b = a + c`. `a` becomes 144, `b` becomes 233, and `c` becomes 8.
7. Iteration 6: `c` is greater than or equal to `n`, so the function returns `a`, which is 233.

Therefore, the assertion statement `assert (prime_fib(6) == 233);` passes, and the final result is:

The assertion statement `assert (prime_fib(7) == 1597)` checks if the 7-th prime number in the Fibonacci sequence is equal to 1597. To determine the result of the assertion, we need to evaluate the `prime_fib` function with the input `7`.

The `prime_fib` function starts by initializing `a` to 1, `b` to 2, and `c` to 0. The function then enters a loop where it checks if `c` is less than `n`. Since `n` is 7, the loop will execute 7 times.

In the first iteration, `a` is set to 1, `b` is set to 2, and `c` is set to 0. The function updates `a` and `b` using the recurrence relation `a = b + c` and `b = a + c`, which gives `a = 3` and `b = 5`. The function then increments `c` by 1, which gives `c = 1`.

The process continues for 5 more iterations, with `a`, `b`, and `c` being updated according to the recurrence relation. After the 7th iteration, `a` is set to 1597, `b` is set to 2584, and `c` is set to 7. The function then returns `a`, which is 1597.

Therefore, the assertion statement `assert (prime_fib(7) == 1597)` passes, as the 7-th prime number in the Fibonacci sequence is indeed 1597.

To do this, we can start by looking at the loop in the `prime_fib` function. The loop starts by initializing `a`, `b`, and `c` to 1, 2, and 0, respectively. The loop then checks if `c` is less than `n`. Since `n` is 8, the loop will execute 8 times.

In each iteration of the loop, the function updates `a` and `b` using the recurrence relation `a = b + c` and `b = a + c`, and then increments `c` by 1. The updated values of `a` and `b` are then used to compute the next value of `c`.

After 8 iterations, the value of `c` will be 8, which is greater than or equal to `n`. Therefore, the loop will exit and the function will return `b`, which is currently equal to 28657.

To do this, we can start by looking at the loop in the `prime_fib` function. The loop starts by initializing `a`, `b`, and `c` to 1, 2, and 0, respectively. The loop then checks if `c` is less than `n`, which is 9 in this case. Since `c` is less than `n`, the loop updates `a` and `b` using the recurrence relation and increments `c` by 1.

The loop then checks if `c` is less than `n` again. Since `c` is now 1, it is still less than `n`, so the loop updates `a` and `b` again and increments `c` by 1.

The loop continues in this manner, updating `a` and `b` and incrementing `c` each time it checks if `c` is less than `n`. After 9 iterations, `c` will be equal to `n`, and the loop will return `a`, which is the 9th prime number in the Fibonacci sequence.

Therefore, the value of `prime_fib(9)` is 514229, which is the 9th prime number in the Fibonacci sequence. Since this value is equal to the value given in the assertion statement, the assertion passes.
