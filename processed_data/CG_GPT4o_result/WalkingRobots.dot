To create a call graph in the DOT format from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we need to identify the functions and their relationships (i.e., which function calls which). The main function and any other functions called within it will be represented as nodes, with directed edges indicating the calls.

Below is the DOT representation of the call graph for the provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes representing functions
    node [shape=box];

    _GLOBAL__sub_I_WalkingRobots.cpp;
    _ZNSt8ios_base4InitC1Ev;
    _ZNSt8ios_base4InitD1Ev;
    __cxa_atexit;
    _Z17howManyCollisionsNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE;
    main;
    @freopen;
    @_ZNSirsERi;
    @_ZStrsIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEERSt13basic_istreamIT_T0_ES7_RNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIS4_S5_T1_EE;
    @_ZNSolsEi;
    @_ZNSo3putEc;
    @_ZNSo5flushEv;
    @_ZSt16__throw_bad_castv;
    @_ZNKSt5ctypeIcE13_M_widen_initEv;
    @_ZdlPv;
    @_ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE9_M_createERmm;
    @llvm.vector.reduce.add.v4i32;

    // Edges representing function calls
    main -> @freopen;
    main -> @_ZNSirsERi;
    main -> @_ZStrsIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEERSt13basic_istreamIT_T0_ES7_RNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIS4_S5_T1_EE;
    main -> @_ZNSolsEi;
    main -> @_ZNSo3putEc;
    main -> @_ZNSo5flushEv;
    _GLOBAL__sub_I_WalkingRobots.cpp -> _ZNSt8ios_base4InitC1Ev;
    _GLOBAL__sub_I_WalkingRobots.cpp -> __cxa_atexit;
    _Z17howManyCollisionsNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE -> @llvm.vector.reduce.add.v4i32;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each unique function from your IR code is represented as a node in the graph.
- The arrows (edges) indicate calls from one function to another. For example, `main` calls several functions, and this is represented with directed edges from `main` to those functions.
- The names of the functions are taken directly from the IR code, keeping in mind their mangled names as per C++ name mangling conventions.

You can visualize this graph using tools that support the DOT format (like Graphviz).
