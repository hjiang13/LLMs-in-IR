To create a call graph in DOT format based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will identify the functions and their relationships (i.e., which functions call which other functions). 

Here's the call graph representation in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    rankdir=TB;

    // Nodes for each function
    main [label="main()"];
    gcd [label="gcdxx(i64, i64)"];
    mod_inv [label="mod_invxx(i64, i64)"];
    egcd [label="egcdxx(i64, i64)"];
    global_sub [label="_GLOBAL__sub_I_RationalSums.cpp()"];
    sync_with_stdio [label="_ZNSt8ios_base15sync_with_stdioEb(i1)"];
    freopen_func [label="freopen(i8*, i8*, _IO_FILE*)"];
    cin_extract [label="_ZNSi10_M_extractIxEERSiRT_(%"class.std::basic_istream"*, i64*)"];
    cout_insert [label="_ZNSo9_M_insertIxEERSoT_(%"class.std::basic_ostream"*, i64)"];
    put_char [label="_ZNSo3putEc(%"class.std::basic_ostream"*, i8)"];
    flush [label="_ZNSo5flushEv(%"class.std::basic_ostream"*)"];
    throw_bad_cast [label="_ZSt16__throw_bad_castv()"];

    // Edges to represent function calls
    main -> global_sub;
    main -> sync_with_stdio;
    main -> freopen_func;
    main -> cin_extract;
    main -> cout_insert;

    gcd -> egcd;
    mod_inv -> egcd;
    mod_inv -> gcd;

    global_sub -> sync_with_stdio;
    
    // Additional edges for internal function calls
    cout_insert -> put_char;
    cout_insert -> flush;
    
    // Bad cast exception
    cout_insert -> throw_bad_cast;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each function is represented as a node in the graph.
- The edges represent the calls made from one function to another. For instance, `main()` calls several functions like `global_sub`, `sync_with_stdio`, etc.
- The functions `gcd`, `mod_inv`, and `egcd` are linked to show their dynamic calls.
- I've included function declarations that seem pertinent to the program as nodes, such as `freopen`, `cin_extract`, and `cout_insert`, based on their usage in the `main` function.

You can visualize this DOT code using graph visualization tools like Graphviz. Just save the content in a `.dot` file and render it with Graphviz to see the call graph.
