To generate a call graph from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will analyze the functions defined in the code and extract the function calls that occur within those functions. The call graph will be represented in the DOT format, which is commonly used with graph visualization tools.

Here's the call graph based on the IR code you provided:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Define the nodes representing the functions
    main [label="main()"];
    Cut [label="Cut(int, int, int)"];
    Link [label="Link(int, int, int)"];
    query [label="query(int)"];
    addix [label="addix(int, long)"];
    getii [label="getii(int, int)"];
    downdate [label="downdate(T*)"];
    update [label="update(T*)"];
    rotate [label="rotate(T*, bool)"];
    xiao [label="xiao(T*)"];
    splay [label="splay(T*)"];
    access [label="access(T*)"];
    get [label="get(T*, int, int)"];
    ios_base_init [label="ios_base::Init()"];
    ios_base_destroy [label="ios_base::Init::~Init()"];
    __clang_call_terminate [label="__clang_call_terminate(i8*)"];
    __cxa_atexit [label="__cxa_atexit(void (i8*)*, i8*, i8*)"];
    Rb_tree_erase [label="_Rb_tree::erase(Rb_tree_node*)"];
    Rb_tree_insert [label="_Rb_tree::insert(Rb_tree_node*)"];
    Rb_tree_decrement [label="_Rb_tree::decrement(Rb_tree_node_base*)"];
    Rb_tree_increment [label="_Rb_tree::increment(Rb_tree_node_base*)"];
    Rb_tree_emplace_hint_unique [label="_Rb_tree::emplace_hint_unique()"];
    
    // Define the edges representing calls between functions
    main -> Cut;
    main -> Link;
    main -> query;
    main -> addix;
    main -> getii;
    
    Cut -> getii;
    Cut -> access;
    
    Link -> getii;
    Link -> access;
    
    query -> getii;
    
    addix -> access;
    
    downdate -> update;
    
    update -> rotate;
    
    splay -> xiao;
    splay -> access;
    
    access -> splay;
    
    getii -> Rb_tree_insert;
    
    Rb_tree_insert -> Rb_tree_emplace_hint_unique;
    
    ios_base_init -> ios_base_destroy;
    
    __cxa_atexit -> ios_base_destroy;
    
    Rb_tree_erase -> Rb_tree_decrement;
    Rb_tree_erase -> Rb_tree_increment;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each function is represented as a node in the graph.
- The edges represent function calls; for example, `main` calls `Cut`, `Link`, `query`, etc.
- The function names are derived from the mangled names in the IR code, and they have been simplified for readability.
- The graph uses directed edges to indicate which function calls which other function.

This format can be used with graph visualization tools like Graphviz to create a visual representation of the call graph.
