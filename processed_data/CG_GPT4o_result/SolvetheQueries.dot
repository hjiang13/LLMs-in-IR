To create a call graph from the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we will extract the function declarations and definitions, and then represent them as nodes in a directed graph. The edges will represent the calls between these functions.

Here's the call graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Function Declarations and Definitions
    main;
    _Z7fastpowiii;
    _Z6modifyiiiiiPi;
    _Z5queryiiiiiPi;
    _Z5buildiii;
    _Z4pushiii;
    _Z7convertiPi;
    @_ZSt4cout;
    @_ZSt3cin;
    @_ZNSolsEi;
    @_ZNSo3putEc;
    @_ZNSo5flushEv;
    @_ZNSt8ios_base4InitC1Ev;
    @_ZNSt8ios_base4InitD1Ev;
    @__cxa_atexit;

    // Function Calls
    main -> _Z6modifyiiiiiPi;
    main -> _Z5queryiiiiiPi;
    main -> _Z5buildiii;
    _Z6modifyiiiiiPi -> _Z5queryiiiiiPi;
    _Z5queryiiiiiPi -> _Z7convertiPi;
    _Z5buildiii -> _Z5buildiii; // Recursive Call
    _Z5buildiii -> _Z4pushiii;
    _Z7convertiPi -> _Z5buildiii;
    _Z4pushiii -> _Z5buildiii;
    _Z7fastpowiii -> _Z7fastpowiii; // Recursive Call
    _Z7fastpowiii -> _Z6modifyiiiiiPi;

    // Other function calls to external functions
    main -> @_ZNSolsEi;
    main -> @_ZNSo3putEc;
    main -> @_ZNSo5flushEv;
    _Z5queryiiiiiPi -> @_ZNSolsEi;
    _Z5queryiiiiiPi -> @_ZNSo3putEc;
    _Z6modifyiiiiiPi -> @_ZNSo5flushEv;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Nodes**: Each function is represented as a node in the graph. The function names are included as node labels.
2. **Edges**: The directed edges represent function calls:
   - For example, `main` calls `_Z6modifyiiiiiPi`, which means there's an edge from `main` to `_Z6modifyiiiiiPi`.
   - Recursive calls are also indicated, such as `_Z5buildiii` calling itself.

This representation allows you to visualize the relationships between the functions in the code. You can use a tool like Graphviz to visualize the DOT format.
