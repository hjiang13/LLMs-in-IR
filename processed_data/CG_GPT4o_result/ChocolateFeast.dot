To create a call graph in the DOT format based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we need to identify functions in the code and the calls made between them. Below is a simplified representation of the call graph in the DOT format, showcasing the functions as nodes and their relationships as edges.

### DOT Format of the Call Graph

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    main [label="main()"];
    _GLOBAL__sub_I_ChocolateFeast_cpp [label="_GLOBAL__sub_I_ChocolateFeast.cpp()"];
    _ZNSt8ios_base4InitC1Ev [label="_ZNSt8ios_base4InitC1Ev()"];
    _ZNSt8ios_base4InitD1Ev [label="_ZNSt8ios_base4InitD1Ev()"];
    __cxa_atexit [label="__cxa_atexit()"];
    freopen [label="freopen()"];
    _ZNSirsERi [label="_ZNSirsERi()"];
    _ZNSolsEi [label="_ZNSolsEi()"];
    _ZNSo3putEc [label="_ZNSo3putEc()"];
    _ZNSo5flushEv [label="_ZNSo5flushEv()"];
    _ZSt16__throw_bad_castv [label="_ZSt16__throw_bad_castv()"];
    _ZNKSt5ctypeIcE13_M_widen_initEv [label="_ZNKSt5ctypeIcE13_M_widen_initEv()"];

    // Edges
    _GLOBAL__sub_I_ChocolateFeast_cpp -> _ZNSt8ios_base4InitC1Ev;
    _GLOBAL__sub_I_ChocolateFeast_cpp -> __cxa_atexit;
    main -> _ZNSirsERi;
    main -> _ZNSolsEi;
    main -> _ZNSo3putEc;
    main -> _ZNSo5flushEv;
    main -> _ZSt16__throw_bad_castv;
    main -> _ZNKSt5ctypeIcE13_M_widen_initEv;
    main -> freopen;
}
```

### Explanation:

- Each function from the IR code is represented as a node in the graph.
- The edges indicate calls from one function to another.
- The labels for each node correspond to the function names as they appear in the IR code.
- The main function is the entry point, and its relationships with other functions are displayed through directed edges.

This representation allows you to visualize the relationships and flow of calls between functions in the IR code.
