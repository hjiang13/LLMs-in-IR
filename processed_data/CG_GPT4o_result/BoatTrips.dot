Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can extract the function calls and construct a call graph in the DOT format. The functions referenced in the IR code will be represented as nodes, and edges will indicate the function calls.

Here is the call graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    main [label="main()"];
    _GLOBAL__sub_I_BoatTrips_cpp [label="_GLOBAL__sub_I_BoatTrips.cpp()"];
    _ZNSt8ios_base4InitC1Ev [label="_ZNSt8ios_base4InitC1Ev()"];
    _ZNSt8ios_base4InitD1Ev [label="_ZNSt8ios_base4InitD1Ev()"];
    __cxa_atexit [label="__cxa_atexit()"];
    puts [label="puts()"];
    freopen [label="freopen()"];
    _ZNSirsERi [label="_ZNSirsERi()"];
    llvm_lifetime_start [label="llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8()"];
    llvm_lifetime_end [label="llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8()"];

    // Edges
    main -> _GLOBAL__sub_I_BoatTrips_cpp;
    main -> freopen;
    main -> _ZNSirsERi;
    main -> puts;
    _GLOBAL__sub_I_BoatTrips_cpp -> _ZNSt8ios_base4InitC1Ev;
    _GLOBAL__sub_I_BoatTrips_cpp -> __cxa_atexit;
    _ZNSt8ios_base4InitD1Ev -> __cxa_atexit;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each function is represented as a node in the graph, labeled with its name.
- The arrows (edges) indicate calls from one function to another.
- The `main` function is the entry point, which calls the `_GLOBAL__sub_I_BoatTrips.cpp()` function, as well as `freopen`, `_ZNSirsERi`, and `puts`.
- The `_GLOBAL__sub_I_BoatTrips.cpp()` function initializes `ios_base::Init`, and it also registers a destructor `__cxa_atexit` that is called when the program exits.
- Lifetime management functions (`llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8` and `llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8`) are used for managing object lifetimes but are not explicitly included in the call graph to keep it concise.

Feel free to modify the labels or structure as per the requirements!
