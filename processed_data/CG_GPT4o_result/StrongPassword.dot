To create a call graph from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we need to extract the function calls and their relationships. The call graph will represent functions as nodes and calls between them as directed edges.

Here's the call graph in dot format, which you can visualize using graph visualization tools like Graphviz:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    main [label="main()"];
    check [label="_Z5checkNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEES4_"];
    ios_base_init [label="_ZNSt8ios_base4InitC1Ev"];
    ios_base_deinit [label="_ZNSt8ios_base4InitD1Ev"];
    __cxa_atexit [label="__cxa_atexit"];
    find [label="_ZNKSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE4findEcm"];
    printf [label="printf"];
    free [label="_ZdlPv"];
    _GLOBAL_sub_I_StrongPassword_cpp [label="_GLOBAL__sub_I_StrongPassword.cpp"];
    freopen [label="freopen"];
    cin_read [label="_ZNSirsERi"];
    cin_string_read [label="_ZStrsIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEERSt13basic_istreamIT_T0_ES7_RNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIS4_S5_T1_EE"];
    mem_copy [label="llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64"];
    lifetime_start [label="llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8"];
    lifetime_end [label="llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8"];

    // Edges
    main -> ios_base_init;
    main -> __cxa_atexit;
    main -> check;
    main -> printf;
    main -> free;
    main -> freopen;
    main -> cin_read;
    main -> cin_string_read;
    main -> mem_copy;
    main -> lifetime_start;
    main -> lifetime_end;
    check -> find;
    ios_base_init -> ios_base_deinit;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each function is represented as a node, where the label shows the function's name.
- Directed edges indicate a call from one function to another.
- The `main` function is the entry point and calls several other functions.
- The `check` function calls the `find` function.
- `ios_base_init` and `ios_base_deinit` are part of the initialization and cleanup of the IO operations, respectively.
- The `printf` and memory-related functions (`free`, `mem_copy`, etc.) are also included as nodes in the graph, showing that they are called from `main`.

You can use this dot representation to visualize the call graph in any compatible tool.
