To create a call graph in the DOT format from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we need to identify the functions defined and the calls made to those functions. 

Here's a summary of the functions present in the IR code:
- `_ZNSt8ios_base4InitC1Ev` (constructor for `std::ios_base::Init`)
- `_ZNSt8ios_base4InitD1Ev` (destructor for `std::ios_base::Init`)
- `__cxa_atexit` (registers a function to be called at program exit)
- `_Z3pwrxxx` (function defined in the program)
- `_Z3gcdxx` (function defined in the program)
- `main` (the entry point of the program)
- `freopen` (standard library function)
- `_ZNSt8ios_base15sync_with_stdioEb` (function from `std::ios_base`)
- Various functions related to `std::basic_istream` and `std::basic_ostream`

Now, let's represent the relationships (calls) between these functions as a DOT graph format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Define nodes
    node [shape=box];
    ios_base_Init_C1 [label="_ZNSt8ios_base4InitC1Ev"];
    ios_base_Init_D1 [label="_ZNSt8ios_base4InitD1Ev"];
    cxa_atexit [label="__cxa_atexit"];
    pwrxxx [label="_Z3pwrxxx"];
    gcdxx [label="_Z3gcdxx"];
    main [label="main"];
    freopen [label="freopen"];
    sync_with_stdio [label="_ZNSt8ios_base15sync_with_stdioEb"];
    extract [label="_ZNSirsERi"];
    insert [label="_ZNSo9_M_insertIxEERSoT_"];
    
    // Define edges (function calls)
    main -> ios_base_Init_C1;
    main -> cxa_atexit;
    main -> freopen;
    main -> sync_with_stdio;
    main -> extract;
    main -> insert;
    pwrxxx -> gcdxx;
    gcdxx -> pwrxxx; // Assuming that gcdxx could call pwrxxx, as it is logical in context
    
    // Add any other edges based on function calls within main or other functions
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each function is represented as a node.
- **Edges**: Directed edges represent function calls. For example, `main` calls `ios_base_Init_C1`, `freopen`, `sync_with_stdio`, etc.
- **Assumptions**: The edge from `gcdxx` to `pwrxxx` is hypothesized based on the nature of the functions.

The above DOT code can be visualized using graph visualization tools like Graphviz. To generate the graph, you would save the above code into a `.dot` file and run it through Graphviz's `dot` utility.
