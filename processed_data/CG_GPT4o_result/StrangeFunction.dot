Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can extract the function definitions and their relationships to create a call graph. The call graph will show which functions invoke which other functions. Below is the representation of the call graph in the DOT format.

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    rankdir=LR;
    node [shape=box];

    main [label="main()"];
    gcd [label="gcd(int, int)"];
    getMini [label="getMini(int, int)"];
    getMax [label="getMax(int, int)"];
    getGcd [label="getGcd(int, int)"];
    goLeft [label="goLeft(int, int)"];
    goRight [label="goRight(int, int)"];
    Solve [label="Solve(int, int, int)"];
    __clang_call_terminate [label="__clang_call_terminate()"];
    __cxa_atexit [label="__cxa_atexit()"];
    _ZSt4cout [label="_ZSt4cout"];
    _ZSt16__introsort_loop [label="_ZSt16__introsort_loop()"];
    _ZSt22__final_insertion_sort [label="_ZSt22__final_insertion_sort()"];
    _ZSt14__partial_sort [label="_ZSt14__partial_sort()"];
    _ZSt13__adjust_heap [label="_ZSt13__adjust_heap()"];
    _ZSt22__move_median_to_first [label="_ZSt22__move_median_to_first()"];

    // Edges
    main -> gcd;
    main -> getMini;
    main -> getMax;
    main -> getGcd;
    main -> goLeft;
    main -> goRight;
    main -> Solve;
    gcd -> getGcd;
    goLeft -> Solve;
    goRight -> Solve;
    Solve -> getMini;
    Solve -> getMax;
    _ZSt14__partial_sort -> _ZSt16__introsort_loop;
    _ZSt22__final_insertion_sort -> _ZSt16__introsort_loop;
    _ZSt14__partial_sort -> _ZSt22__final_insertion_sort;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each function is represented as a node in the graph with its name.
- Directed edges are added from calling functions to the functions they invoke.
- The `main` function serves as the starting point of the program, leading to various helper functions like `gcd`, `getMini`, `getMax`, etc.
- The sorting related functions are connected as they call each other during their operations.

You can visualize this graph using graph visualization tools that accept DOT format, such as Graphviz.
