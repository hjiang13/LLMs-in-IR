To create a call graph from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will identify the functions defined in the code and the calls made to these functions. The output will be in DOT format for visualization purposes. 

Here's the representation of the call graph based on the provided IR:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes representing functions
    node [shape=box];
    main [label="main()"];
    update [label="_Z6updatei(int)"];
    query [label="_Z5queryii(int, int)"];
    cxx_global_array_dtor [label="__cxx_global_array_dtor(i8*)"];
    introsort_loop [label="_ZSt16__introsort_loopIP2SSlN9__gnu_cxx5__ops15_Iter_less_iterEEvT_S5_T0_T1_"];
    make_heap [label="_ZSt11__make_heapIP2SSN9__gnu_cxx5__ops15_Iter_less_iterEEvT_S5_RT0_"];
    pop_heap [label="_ZSt10__pop_heapIP2SSN9__gnu_cxx5__ops15_Iter_less_iterEEvT_S5_S5_RT0_"];
    adjust_heap [label="_ZSt13__adjust_heapIP2SSlS0_N9__gnu_cxx5__ops15_Iter_less_iterEEvT_T0_S6_T1_T2_"];
    push_heap [label="_ZSt11__push_heapIP2SSlS0_N9__gnu_cxx5__ops14_Iter_less_valEEvT_T0_S6_T1_RT2_"];
    move_median [label="_ZSt22__move_median_to_firstIP2SSN9__gnu_cxx5__ops15_Iter_less_iterEEvT_S5_S5_S5_T0_"];
    unguarded_partition [label="_ZSt21__unguarded_partitionIP2SSN9__gnu_cxx5__ops15_Iter_less_iterEET_S5_S5_S5_T0_"];
    swap [label="_ZSt4swapI2SSENSt9enable_ifIXsr6__and_ISt6__not_ISt15__is_tuple_likeIT_EESt21is_move_constructibleIS4_ESt18is_move_assignableIS4_EEE5valueEvE4typeERS4_SD_"];
    
    // Edges representing function calls
    main -> update;
    main -> query;
    main -> cxx_global_array_dtor;
    main -> introsort_loop;
    main -> make_heap;
    main -> pop_heap;
    main -> adjust_heap;
    main -> push_heap;
    main -> move_median;
    main -> unguarded_partition;
    main -> swap;
    
    update -> main;
    query -> update;
    query -> swap;
    
    cxx_global_array_dtor -> main;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Nodes**: Each function is represented as a node in the graph, with its name as the label.
2. **Edges**: Directed edges are drawn from a calling function to the function it calls.
3. The functions are represented in a simple box shape for clarity.

This representation can be visualized using graph visualization tools that understand the DOT format, such as Graphviz. You can save the above text to a file with a `.dot` extension and use Graphviz to create a graphical representation of the call graph.
