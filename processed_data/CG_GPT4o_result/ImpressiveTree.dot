To construct a call graph from the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we will identify the functions and their calls to other functions. We will then represent this information in the DOT format, which can be used to visualize the call graph.

Here's the call graph in DOT format, focusing on the function names as nodes and the calls as directed edges:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes (functions)
    main [label="main()"];
    dfs [label="_Z3dfsii(i32, i32)"];
    query [label="_Z5queryii(i32, i32)"];
    update [label="_Z6updateix(i32, i64)"];
    __cxx_global_array_dtor [label="__cxx_global_array_dtor(i8*)"];
    __GLOBAL__sub_I_ImpressiveTree_cpp [label="__GLOBAL__sub_I_ImpressiveTree.cpp()"];
    __assert_fail [label="__assert_fail(i8*, i8*, i32, i8*)"];
    _ZdlPv [label="_ZdlPv(i8*)"];
    _ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc [label="_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc(i8*)"];
    _Znwm [label="_Znwm(i64)"];
    __isoc99_scanf [label="__isoc99_scanf(i8*, ...)"];
    printf [label="printf(i8*, ...)"];
    freopen [label="freopen(i8*, i8*, %struct._IO_FILE*)"];

    // Edges (function calls)
    main -> dfs;
    main -> query;
    main -> update;
    dfs -> dfs; // Recursive call
    dfs -> dfs; // Recursive call
    query -> query; // Recursive call
    update -> update; // Recursive call
    __GLOBAL__sub_I_ImpressiveTree_cpp -> __cxx_global_array_dtor;
    main -> __assert_fail;
    main -> __isoc99_scanf;
    main -> printf;
    main -> fread;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Nodes**: Each function is represented as a node, identified by its name. The label shows the function's signature.
2. **Edges**: Directed edges indicate function calls. For example, `main` calls `dfs`, `query`, and `update`.
3. **Recursive Calls**: Functions like `dfs` and `query` call themselves, hence the self-loops.

You can visualize this graph using tools that support the DOT language, such as Graphviz. Just save the content above into a `.dot` file and use Graphviz to generate the graphical representation.
