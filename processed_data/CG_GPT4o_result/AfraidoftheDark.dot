To create a call graph in DOT format from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we need to identify the functions and their relationships based on function calls. 

From the IR code, the functions defined are:
1. `main()`
2. `_Z4sizeiii(i32, i32, i32)`
3. `_Z5solveiii(i32, i32, i32)`
4. `_ZNSt6vectorIS_ISt4pairIiiESaIS1_EESaIS3_EED2Ev()`
5. `_GLOBAL__sub_I_AfraidoftheDark.cpp()`
6. Various external functions such as `@__cxa_atexit`, `@freopen`, `_ZNSirsERi`, `_ZNSolsEi`, etc.

Hereâ€™s the call graph in DOT format, showing the functions as nodes and their calls as edges:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    main [label="main()"];
    size [label="_Z4sizeiii(i32, i32, i32)"];
    solve [label="_Z5solveiii(i32, i32, i32)"];
    vector_destructor [label="_ZNSt6vectorIS_ISt4pairIiiESaIS1_EESaIS3_EED2Ev()"];
    global_sub [label="_GLOBAL__sub_I_AfraidoftheDark.cpp()"];
    atexit [label="__cxa_atexit"];
    freopen [label="freopen"];
    cin [label="_ZNSirsERi"];
    cout [label="_ZNSolsEi"];
    throw_length_error [label="_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc"];
    new [label="_Znwm"];
    memset [label="llvm.memset.p0i8.i64"];

    // Edges
    main -> size;
    main -> solve;
    main -> vector_destructor;
    main -> global_sub;
    main -> atexit;
    main -> freopen;
    main -> cin;
    main -> cout;
    
    solve -> solve; // recursive call
    solve -> size;

    global_sub -> vector_destructor;
    global_sub -> atexit;

    // Other external calls
    size -> throw_length_error;
    size -> new;
    solve -> throw_length_error;
    solve -> new;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each function is represented as a node in the graph.
- Directed edges represent calls made from one function to another.
- Recursive calls are also represented as edges pointing back to the same function.
- External functions that are called within the defined functions are included as nodes with edges from the calling function.

This representation gives a clear overview of how functions interact with each other in the given IR code.
