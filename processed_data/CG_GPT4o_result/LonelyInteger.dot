To create a call graph in DOT format from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will identify the functions and their calls. Each function will be represented as a node, and each call to another function will be represented as an edge between the nodes.

Here’s how we can represent the call graph based on the functions found in the IR code:

1. **Identify Functions**: We need to find the defined functions and declared functions. The relevant functions from the given IR code include:
    - `@_GLOBAL__sub_I_LonelyInteger.cpp`
    - `@main`
    - `_Z13lonelyintegerSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`
    - `@_ZSt17__throw_bad_allocv`
    - `@_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc`
    - `@_ZdlPv`
    - `@__cxa_atexit`
    - `@llvm.vector.reduce.xor.v4i32`
    - `@freopen`
    - `@_ZNSirsERi`
    - `@_ZNSi6ignoreEli`
    - `@_ZNSolsEi`
    - `@llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64`
   
2. **Identify Calls**: We need to look for function calls within the body of the defined functions. 

3. **Construct the DOT representation**:

Here’s the resulting DOT representation of the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    node [shape=box];

    // Nodes
    main [label="main"];
    lonelyinteger [label="lonelyinteger"];
    global_sub [label="GLOBAL__sub_I_LonelyInteger.cpp"];
    throw_bad_alloc [label="__throw_bad_alloc"];
    throw_length_error [label="__throw_length_error"];
    delete [label="dlPv"];
    cxa_atexit [label="__cxa_atexit"];
    llvm_vector_reduce [label="llvm.vector.reduce.xor.v4i32"];
    freopen [label="freopen"];
    ios_read [label="ZNSirsERi"];
    ignore [label="ZNSi6ignoreEli"];
    ios_write [label="ZNSolsEi"];
    llvm_memmove [label="llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64"];

    // Edges
    main -> global_sub;
    main -> ios_read;
    main -> ignore;
    main -> ios_write;
    main -> throw_bad_alloc;
    main -> throw_length_error;
    main -> delete;
    main -> llvm_memmove;
    
    lonelyinteger -> llvm_vector_reduce;
    lonelyinteger -> throw_length_error;
    lonelyinteger -> delete;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each function is represented as a node with its name as the label.
- The arrows (edges) represent the calls made from one function to another. For example, the `main` function calls several functions, and this is indicated with directed edges pointing from the `main` node to other function nodes.
- The names of the functions are derived from the mangled names in the IR code, which often encode additional information like parameter types. 

This DOT file can be visualized using graph visualization tools that support the DOT format, such as Graphviz.
