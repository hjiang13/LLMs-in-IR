To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the given intermediate representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we need to identify the basic blocks and their connections based on the control flow (branches and jumps). Here's the CFG based on the provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=TB;
    
    // Nodes representing basic blocks
    node [shape=box];

    Entry [label="Entry"];
    Block0 [label="Block 0"];
    Block11 [label="Block 11"];
    Block44 [label="Block 44"];
    Block51 [label="Block 51"];
    Block30 [label="Block 30"];
    Block31 [label="Block 31"];
    Block35 [label="Block 35"];
    Block38 [label="Block 38"];

    // Edges representing control flow
    Entry -> Block0;
    Block0 -> Block11;
    Block0 -> Block51;
    Block11 -> Block30;
    Block11 -> Block31;
    Block31 -> Block35;
    Block31 -> Block38;
    Block35 -> Block44;
    Block38 -> Block44;
    Block44 -> Block11;
    Block44 -> Block51;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each node in the graph represents a basic block in the IR code.
- The edges between nodes indicate the flow of control, such as branches and returns.
- The `Entry` node represents the entry point of the `main` function, leading to `Block0`.
- The IR code has conditional branches leading to different blocks based on conditions, which are captured in the CFG structure. 

This is a simplified representation of the control flow graph without going into the details of the content of each basic block.
