To represent the control flow graph (CFG) in the DOT format based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will extract the function and block labels as nodes, and then identify the edges based on the control flow directives (like `br`, `invoke`, etc.) in the IR code. 

Hereâ€™s the DOT representation of the control flow graph for the function `@main()`:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];

    entry [label="Entry"];
    block0 [label="%0"];
    block1 [label="%1"];
    block22 [label="%22"];
    block24 [label="%24"];
    block31 [label="%31"];
    block34 [label="%34"];
    block40 [label="%40"];
    block55 [label="%55"];
    block57 [label="%57"];
    block65 [label="%65"];
    block67 [label="%67"];
    block82 [label="%82"];
    block84 [label="%84"];
    block92 [label="%92"];
    block93 [label="%93"];
    block108 [label="%108"];
    block110 [label="%110"];
    block117 [label="%117"];
    block121 [label="%121"];
    block136 [label="%136"];
    block145 [label="%145"];
    block152 [label="%152"];
    block154 [label="%154"];
    block159 [label="%159"];
    block161 [label="%161"];
    block173 [label="%173"];
    block175 [label="%175"];
    block180 [label="%180"];
    block182 [label="%182"];
    block192 [label="%192"];
    block194 [label="%194"];
    block203 [label="%203"];
    block206 [label="%206"];
    block213 [label="%213"];
    block218 [label="%218"];
    block221 [label="%221"];
    block233 [label="%233"];
    block234 [label="%234"];
    block235 [label="%235"];
    block242 [label="%242"];
    block243 [label="%243"];
    block249 [label="%249"];
    block252 [label="%252"];
    block254 [label="%254"];
    block257 [label="%257"];
    block260 [label="%260"];
    exit [label="Exit"];

    // Edges
    entry -> block0;
    block0 -> block1;
    block1 -> block22;
    block22 -> block24;
    block24 -> block31;
    block31 -> block34;
    block34 -> block40;
    block40 -> block55;
    block55 -> block57;
    block57 -> block65;
    block65 -> block67;
    block67 -> block82;
    block82 -> block84;
    block84 -> block92;
    block92 -> block93;
    block93 -> block108;
    block108 -> block110;
    block110 -> block117;
    block117 -> block121;
    block121 -> block136;
    block136 -> block145;
    block145 -> block152;
    block31 -> block218;
    block218 -> block221;
    block221 -> block233;
    block233 -> block234;
    block234 -> block235;
    block235 -> block242;
    block242 -> block243;
    block243 -> block249;
    block249 -> block252;
    block252 -> block254;
    block254 -> block257;
    block257 -> block260;
    block218 -> exit;
    block154 -> exit;
    block152 -> exit;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each basic block from the function `@main()` is represented as a node.
- The edges represent the flow of control from one block to another based on the control flow statements in the IR.
- The entry node represents the starting point of the function, and the exit node represents the termination of the function.

This representation is designed to be easily visualized using tools that support DOT format, such as Graphviz. You can copy this DOT code into a file and use Graphviz tools to generate a graphical representation of the control flow graph.
