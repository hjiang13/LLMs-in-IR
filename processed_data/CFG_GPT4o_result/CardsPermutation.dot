To visualize the control flow graph (CFG) of the given intermediate representation (IR) code, we can represent it in DOT format, which is a graph description language. In this graph, each basic block is represented as a node, and edges represent the control flow between these blocks.

Here's the CFG represented in DOT format based on the provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    "main" [label="main"];
    "update" [label="update"];
    "geti" [label="geti"];
    "4" [label="4"];
    "5" [label="5"];
    "3" [label="3"];
    "16" [label="16"];
    "39" [label="39"];
    "32" [label="32"];
    "36" [label="36"];
    "37" [label="37"];
    "58" [label="58"];
    "64" [label="64"];
    "67" [label="67"];
    "76" [label="76"];
    "102" [label="102"];
    "115" [label="115"];
    "127" [label="127"];
    "151" [label="151"];
    "153" [label="153"];
    "224" [label="224"];
    "352" [label="352"];
    "394" [label="394"];
    "396" [label="396"];

    // Edges
    "main" -> "16";
    "16" -> "3";
    "3" -> "5";
    "5" -> "7";
    "5" -> "32";
    "7" -> "39";
    "39" -> "4";
    "39" -> "32";
    "32" -> "36";
    "32" -> "37";
    "36" -> "4";
    "37" -> "58";
    "58" -> "64";
    "64" -> "67";
    "67" -> "76";
    "76" -> "102";
    "102" -> "115";
    "115" -> "127";
    "151" -> "127";
    "153" -> "224";
    "224" -> "352";
    "352" -> "394";
    "394" -> "396";
    "396" -> "401";
    "396" -> "403";
    "401" -> "403";
    "403" -> "407";
}
```

### Explanation of the DOT Format
- The graph is directed (`digraph`), indicating the flow of control.
- Each node corresponds to a basic block in the code. The labels represent the functions and blocks (e.g., `main`, `update`, `geti`, etc.).
- The edges (`->`) indicate the flow of control from one block to another based on the control flow statements (like `br`, `ret`, etc.) found in the IR.

### Notes
- The actual implementation of the program may have further complexity, but this representation captures the control flow structure based on the provided IR code.
- You can visualize this DOT format using tools like Graphviz by saving it to a `.dot` file and using the `dot` command to produce an image.
