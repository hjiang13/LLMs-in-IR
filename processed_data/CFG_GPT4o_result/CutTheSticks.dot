To represent the control flow graph (CFG) from the provided intermediate representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we will identify the basic blocks and their connections (edges) based on the control flow indicated by branches and jumps.

Here is the DOT representation of the control flow graph for the `main` function:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=LR;

    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="Entry"];
    block1 [label="%1 = alloca"];

### Explanation:
- Each `blockN` represents a basic block in the control flow graph.
- The edges show the flow between these blocks, where conditions lead to different branches.
- The `label` attribute on edges indicates the condition for branching.
- The `entry` node represents the start of the function, and the `exit` node represents the end of the function.

You can visualize this graph using tools that support the DOT format, like Graphviz.
