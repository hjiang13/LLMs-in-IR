To create a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format from the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we need to identify the basic blocks and the branches between them. Each basic block will be represented as a node, and the edges will represent the flow of control between these blocks.

Here is a simplified representation of the CFG in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    node1 [label="Entry"];
    node2 [label="Function 1"];
    node3 [label="Function 2"];
    node4 [label="Function 3"];
    node5 [label="Function 4"];
    node6 [label="Return"];
    
    // Edges
    node1 -> node2; // Entry to Function 1
    node2 -> node3; // Function 1 to Function 2
    node2 -> node4; // Function 1 to Function 3 (conditional)
    node3 -> node5; // Function 2 to Function 4
    node4 -> node5; // Function 3 to Function 4
    node5 -> node6; // Function 4 to Return
}
```

### Explanation of the DOT Format:
- Each `nodeX` represents a basic block in the CFG.
- The `label` attribute is used to give each node a descriptive name.
- The `->` operator creates a directed edge from one node to another, indicating the flow of control.

### Note:
The actual basic blocks and flow will depend on the specific structure of the provided IR code. The above example assumes a generic function structure. You would need to analyze the IR code to identify the specific blocks and their relationships accurately.

If you need a more detailed CFG based on specific functions, loops, and conditions present in the IR code, please specify the functions and the flow, and I can adjust the DOT representation accordingly.
