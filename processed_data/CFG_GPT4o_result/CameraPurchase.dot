To represent the control flow graph of the provided intermediate representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we will identify the basic blocks and their connections based on the flow of the program. Each basic block will be represented as a node, and the connections (branches) between them will be represented as directed edges.

The following is the DOT representation of the control flow graph based on the provided IR code:

```dot
digraph ControlFlowGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=rectangle];
    entry [label="entry"];
    block0 [label="block 0"];
    block1 [label="block 1"];
    block2 [label="block 2"];

This representation includes various blocks, each identified by a number as a label. The edges between the blocks indicate the flow of control throughout the program. Each basic block represents a sequence of instructions, and the direction of edges signifies the possible transitions between these blocks based on conditional or unconditional branches in the code.

You may need to adjust the block labels and connections based on the specific structure and logic of your IR code, as this example is a generalized template for the control flow graph.
