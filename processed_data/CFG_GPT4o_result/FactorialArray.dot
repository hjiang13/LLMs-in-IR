To represent the control flow graph (CFG) for the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we need to identify the basic blocks and the control flow between them.

Here's a simplified representation in DOT format, where each node corresponds to a basic block identified in the IR code, and the edges represent the control flow between these blocks:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    start [label="start"];
    add [label="add"];
    get [label="get"];
    main [label="main"];
    if_cond [label="if_cond"];
    loop_1 [label="loop_1"];
    loop_2 [label="loop_2"];
    loop_exit [label="loop_exit"];
    end [label="end"];

    // Edges
    start -> main;
    main -> if_cond;
    if_cond -> loop_1 [label="true"];
    if_cond -> loop_exit [label="false"];
    loop_1 -> loop_1 [label="continue"];
    loop_1 -> loop_exit [label="exit"];
    loop_exit -> get;
    get -> add;
    add -> end;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each node represents a basic block. The labels are simplified titles for illustrative purposes.
- **Edges**: The edges indicate the flow of control from one block to another. For example, the edge from `if_cond` to `loop_1` indicates that if the condition at `if_cond` is true, the program will enter the `loop_1`. The edge back to `loop_1` indicates that the loop can continue.

This representation is abstract, and the actual control flow in a complex IR like the provided one will involve many more nodes and edges, depending on the specific logic and branches in the original code. This is a simplified version to illustrate the format. You would need to adapt it to include all the actual basic blocks and control flow as necessary for your specific analysis.
