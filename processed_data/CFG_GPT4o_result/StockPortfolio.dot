To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided intermediate representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we need to identify the basic blocks and their connections based on the control flow. Each block will be represented as a node, and the edges will represent the control flow between these blocks.

Here's a simplified representation of the control flow graph in DOT format based on the provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes (basic blocks)
    start [label="entry"];
    block1 [label="block 1"];
    block2 [label="block 2"];
    block3 [label="block 3"];

In this representation:
- Each block is represented by a node with a label indicating its basic block number.
- The directed edges represent the control flow from one block to another.

Please note that the actual basic block structure and connections may vary based on the specifics of the IR code and the branching logic present in it. The above representation is a simplified example and may not accurately reflect the exact structure of the provided IR code.
