To create a control flow graph (CFG) from the given IR code, we will extract the basic blocks and their connections (edges). Each basic block will be represented as a node, and the control flow between them will be represented as directed edges.

Here is the CFG in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes for basic blocks
    0 [label="Entry"];
    1 [label="Block 1"];
    15 [label="Block 15"];
    24 [label="Block 24"];
    31 [label="Block 31"];
    45 [label="Block 45"];
    46 [label="Block 46"];
    50 [label="Block 50"];
    53 [label="Block 53"];
    59 [label="Block 59"];
    66 [label="Block 66"];
    
    // Edges
    0 -> 1;
    1 -> 15;
    15 -> 24;
    15 -> 66;
    24 -> 31;
    24 -> 24; // Loop back from Block 24 to Block 24
    31 -> 45;
    31 -> 46;
    46 -> 50;
    46 -> 53;
    50 -> 59;
    53 -> 59;
    59 -> 15;
    59 -> 66;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each basic block is represented by a node with a unique label.
- The edges represent the control flow between the blocks.
- The entry point of the function is labeled as `Entry`, which transitions into `Block 1`.
- The blocks are connected based on the flow of control observed in the IR code.
- The loop structure is indicated by the edge from `Block 24` back to itself, representing a loop. 

You can visualize this graph using any DOT viewer or graph visualization tool that supports the DOT format.
