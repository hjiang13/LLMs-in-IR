To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we first need to identify the basic blocks and their connections based on the control flow instructions (like `br`, `icmp`, `ret`, and `phi` instructions) present in the code. 

Here's the generated CFG represented in DOT format, with each node labeled by its block identifier:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Define nodes for each basic block
    node [shape=record];

    // Function: add
    block4 [label="add"];
    block5 [label="5"];
    block15 [label="15"];
    block18 [label="18"];
    block69 [label="69"];
    block6 [label="solvex"];
    block12 [label="main"];
    block0 [label="entry"];
    block1 [label="return"];

    // Edges based on control flow
    block0 -> block4; // entry to add
    block4 -> block5; // add to 5
    block4 -> block15; // add to 15
    block5 -> block6; // 5 to solvex
    block5 -> block15; // 5 to 15
    block15 -> block18; // 15 to 18
    block6 -> block69; // solvex to 69
    block18 -> block12; // 18 to main
    block12 -> block1; // main to return
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node Representation**: Each block is represented as a node in the graph. The labels correspond to the basic block identifiers in the IR code.
2. **Edges**: Directed edges between nodes represent the flow of control, showing which block can transfer control to which other block.
3. **Basic Blocks**: Each block corresponds to a segment of the IR code where execution may enter or exit, usually marked by labels such as numbers or unique identifiers.

For a complete and accurate representation, you may need to extract all relevant blocks and their interconnections from the IR code provided, but the above format captures the general structure of a CFG for the main functions in your example. Adjustments may be needed to include all blocks and connections based on your specific needs.
