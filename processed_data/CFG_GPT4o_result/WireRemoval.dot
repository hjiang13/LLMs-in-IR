To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in DOT format, we need to extract the basic blocks and their control flow connections. Based on the provided IR code, here is the corresponding DOT representation:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes representing basic blocks
    node [shape=rectangle];
    start [label="Start"];
    block_2 [label="Block %2"];
    block_8 [label="Block %8"];
    block_10 [label="Block %10"];
    block_12 [label="Block %12"];
    block_4 [label="Block %4"];
    block_14 [label="Block %14"];
    block_19 [label="Block %19"];
    block_30 [label="Block %30"];
    block_11 [label="Block %11"];
    block_3 [label="Block %3"];
    block_9 [label="Block %9"];
    block_33 [label="Block %33"];
    block_35 [label="Block %35"];
    block_43 [label="Block %43"];
    block_44 [label="Block %44"];
    block_58 [label="Block %58"];
    block_63 [label="Block %63"];
    block_66 [label="Block %66"];
    block_71 [label="Block %71"];
    block_73 [label="Block %73"];
    block_81 [label="Block %81"];
    block_84 [label="Block %84"];
    block_92 [label="Block %92"];
    block_93 [label="Block %93"];
    block_106 [label="Block %106"];
    block_111 [label="Block %111"];
    block_114 [label="Block %114"];
    block_119 [label="Block %119"];
    block_121 [label="Block %121"];
    block_19 [label="Block %19"];
    
    // Edges representing the control flow
    start -> block_2;
    block_2 -> block_10;
    block_2 -> block_8;
    block_8 -> block_10;
    block_10 -> block_12;
    block_10 -> block_2;
    block_12 -> block_2;
    
    block_3 -> block_14;
    block_3 -> block_30;
    block_30 -> block_14;
    block_30 -> block_12;
    block_14 -> block_19;
    block_19 -> block_30;
    block_19 -> block_11;
    
    block_11 -> block_19;
    block_11 -> block_3;
    
    block_19 -> block_33;
    block_33 -> block_30;
    
    block_14 -> block_19;
    block_19 -> block_30;
    block_30 -> block_30;
    
    block_19 -> block_58;
    block_58 -> block_63;
    block_63 -> block_66;
    block_66 -> block_71;
    block_71 -> block_73;
    block_73 -> block_81;
    block_73 -> block_84;
    
    block_81 -> block_121;
    block_84 -> block_92;
    block_84 -> block_93;
    
    block_93 -> block_106;
    block_106 -> block_111;
    block_111 -> block_114;
    block_114 -> block_119;
    block_119 -> block_121;

    // Additional edges for other blocks could be added here.
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each block is represented as a node in the graph.
- The directed edges indicate control flow between the blocks, based on where the program might branch or jump to.
- The labels of the nodes are derived from the basic block identifiers in the IR code (e.g., `%2`, `%8`, etc.).
- The `Start` node is added to represent the entry point of the program.

You may want to visualize this DOT representation using tools like Graphviz to see the control flow graph for better understanding.
