Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, here's the control flow graph (CFG) represented in DOT format. Each basic block is represented as a node, and the control flow between the blocks is represented as directed edges.

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=rectangle];
    entry [label="entry"];
    block0 [label="%0"];
    block1 [label="%1"];
    block2 [label="%2"];
    block3 [label="%3"];
    block4 [label="%4"];
    block5 [label="%5"];
    block6 [label="%6"];
    block7 [label="%7"];
    block10 [label="%10"];
    block11 [label="%11"];
    block12 [label="%12"];
    block13 [label="%13"];
    block14 [label="%14"];
    block15 [label="%15"];
    block16 [label="%16"];
    block17 [label="%17"];
    block18 [label="%18"];
    block19 [label="%19"];
    block20 [label="%20"];
    block21 [label="%21"];
    block22 [label="%22"];
    block23 [label="%23"];
    block24 [label="%24"];
    block25 [label="%25"];
    block26 [label="%26"];
    block27 [label="%27"];
    block28 [label="%28"];
    block29 [label="%29"];
    block30 [label="%30"];
    block31 [label="%31"];
    block32 [label="%32"];
    block33 [label="%33"];
    block34 [label="%34"];
    block35 [label="%35"];
    block36 [label="%36"];
    block37 [label="%37"];
    block38 [label="%38"];
    block39 [label="%39"];
    block40 [label="%40"];
    block41 [label="%41"];
    block42 [label="%42"];
    block43 [label="%43"];
    block44 [label="%44"];
    block45 [label="%45"];
    block46 [label="%46"];
    block47 [label="%47"];
    exit [label="exit"];

    // Edges
    entry -> block0;
    block0 -> block1;
    block1 -> block2;
    block2 -> block3;
    block3 -> block4;
    block4 -> block5;
    block5 -> block10;
    block10 -> block11;
    block10 -> block29;
    block11 -> block12;
    block12 -> block13;
    block13 -> block14;
    block14 -> block15;
    block15 -> block16;
    block16 -> block17;
    block17 -> block18;
    block18 -> block19;
    block19 -> block20;
    block20 -> block21;
    block21 -> block22;
    block22 -> block23;
    block23 -> block24;
    block24 -> block25;
    block25 -> block26;
    block26 -> block27;
    block27 -> block28;
    block28 -> block29;
    block29 -> block30;
    block30 -> block31;
    block31 -> block32;
    block32 -> block33;
    block33 -> block34;
    block34 -> block35;
    block35 -> block36;
    block36 -> block37;
    block37 -> block38;
    block38 -> block39;
    block39 -> block40;
    block40 -> block43;
    block43 -> block44;
    block44 -> block45;
    block45 -> block46;
    block46 -> block47;
    block47 -> exit;
}
```

In this DOT representation:
- Each basic block is assigned a label (like `%0`, `%1`, etc.).
- The `entry` node represents the start of the control flow, while the `exit` node represents the end.
- Arrows indicate the flow of control from one block to another.

You can render this DOT format using Graphviz tools to visualize the control flow graph.
