To create a control flow graph (CFG) from the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we will analyze the functions and their respective control flow through branching and jumps. The output will be in the DOT format, which is commonly used for representing graphs.

Here is how the control flow graph for the provided IR code might look in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=TB;
    node [shape=box];

    main [label="main()"];
    f1 [label="_Z3addix"];
    query [label="_Z5queryi"];
    getii [label="_Z3getii"];
    downdate [label="_Z8downdateP1T"];
    update [label="_Z6updateP1T"];
    rotate [label="_Z6rotateP1Tb"];
    xiao [label="_Z4xiaoP1T"];
    splay [label="_Z5splayP1T"];
    Cut [label="_Z3Cutiii"];
    Link [label="_Z4Linkiii"];
    access [label="_Z6accessP1T"];
    
    main -> f1;
    main -> query;
    main -> getii;
    main -> downdate;
    main -> update;
    main -> rotate;
    main -> xiao;
    main -> splay;
    main -> Cut;
    main -> Link;
    main -> access;

    f1 -> f1 [label="Loop"];
    f1 -> 14 [label="Branch"];
    query -> 3;
    query -> 13;
    getii -> 15;
    downdate -> 5;
    update -> 2;
    rotate -> 9;
    xiao -> 11;
    splay -> 6;
    Cut -> 20;
    Link -> 24;
    access -> 26;
    
    // Additional edges based on branching logic can be added here
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each function is represented as a node.
- The edges between nodes represent the control flow between functions.
- Loops and branches are indicated with appropriate labels.
- The nodes are named after the functions in the provided IR code, and their labels describe the function names.
- The structure assumes a basic understanding of how control flow works in a program, where branching (like if statements) and loops dictate which functions might call or return to each other.

This is a simplified representation. In a real-world scenario, you may want to expand upon the specific branches based on the control flow within each function, especially for complex functions with multiple branches and loops.
