To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the given IR code in DOT format, we will create nodes for each basic block and edges to represent the flow between them. Here's the CFG represented in DOT format based on the provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=rectangle];
    entry [label="entry"];
    block0 [label="0"];
    block18 [label="18"];
    block21 [label="21"];
    block39 [label="39"];
    block54 [label="54"];
    block55 [label="55"];
    block62 [label="62"];
    block68 [label="68"];
    exit [label="exit"];

    // Edges
    entry -> block0;
    block0 -> block18;
    block0 -> block39;
    block18 -> block21;
    block21 -> block21;
    block21 -> block39;
    block21 -> block18;
    block39 -> block54;
    block39 -> block55;
    block54 -> exit;
    block55 -> block59;
    block62 -> block68;
    block68 -> exit;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each basic block is represented as a node in the graph.
- The `entry` node represents the start of the program execution.
- The `exit` node represents the termination of the control flow.
- Each edge represents a flow of control from one block to another based on the `br` (branch) instructions in the IR code.
- The labels (block numbers) correspond to the basic block identifiers in the original IR code. 

Feel free to modify the labels or structure as needed!
