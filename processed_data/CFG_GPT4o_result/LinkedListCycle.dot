To create a control flow graph (CFG) based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we need to identify the basic blocks and the relationships (edges) between them. Below is the representation of the CFG in DOT format, which includes only the titles of each basic block:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=TB;

    // Nodes
    node0 [label="Entry"];
    node1 [label="BB1"];
    node2 [label="BB3"];
    node3 [label="BB9"];
    node4 [label="BB11"];
    node5 [label="BB15"];
    node6 [label="BB17"];
    node7 [label="BB21"];
    node8 [label="BB22"];
    node9 [label="BB26"];
    node10 [label="BB30"];
    node11 [label="BB32"];
    node12 [label="BB36"];
    node13 [label="BB40"];
    node14 [label="BB49"];
    node15 [label="BB53"];
    node16 [label="BB57"];
    node17 [label="BB63"];
    node18 [label="BB67"];
    node19 [label="BB70"];
    node20 [label="BB74"];
    node21 [label="BB78"];
    node22 [label="BB84"];
    node23 [label="BB88"];
    node24 [label="BB91"];
    node25 [label="Exit"];

    // Edges
    node0 -> node1;
    node1 -> node2;
    node2 -> node3;
    node3 -> node4;
    node4 -> node5;
    node5 -> node6;
    node6 -> node7;
    node7 -> node8;
    node8 -> node9;
    node9 -> node10;
    node10 -> node11;
    node11 -> node12;
    node12 -> node13;
    node13 -> node14;
    node14 -> node15;
    node15 -> node16;
    node16 -> node17;
    node17 -> node18;
    node18 -> node19;
    node19 -> node20;
    node20 -> node21;
    node21 -> node22;
    node22 -> node23;
    node23 -> node24;
    node24 -> node25;
    node25 -> node1; // Back edge for loops in the function
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each basic block is represented as a node in the graph. The labels of the nodes (e.g., "BB1", "BB3") correspond to the basic blocks in the IR code.
- **Edges**: Directed edges connect nodes based on the control flow described in the IR code. The graph starts from the entry point and follows the flow through the basic blocks. 

This representation provides a clear overview of the control flow in the program without detailing the contents of each block.
