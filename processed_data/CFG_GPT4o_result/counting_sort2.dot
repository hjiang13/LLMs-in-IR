To create a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we need to identify the basic blocks and the flow of control between them. In the provided code, basic blocks are typically marked by labels followed by a colon (e.g., `14:`, `19:`, `24:`). The edges between the blocks are defined by the branching statements (e.g., `br`).

Here is the corresponding DOT representation of the control flow graph based on the provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=rectangle];

    // Nodes
    start [label="start"];
    block_0 [label="0"];
    block_1 [label="1"];
    block_2 [label="2"];
    block_3 [label="3"];
    block_14 [label="14"];
    block_19 [label="19"];
    block_24 [label="24"];
    block_28 [label="28"];
    block_29 [label="29"];
    block_34 [label="34"];
    block_40 [label="40"];
    block_43 [label="43"];

    // Edges
    start -> block_0;
    block_0 -> block_3; // Entry to main
    block_3 -> block_1; // Allocating variables
    block_1 -> block_2; // Loading stdin
    block_2 -> block_14; // First call to `freopen`
    block_14 -> block_19; // Branch on condition (first if)
    block_14 -> block_24; // Branch on second condition

    block_19 -> block_24; // After processing input
    block_24 -> block_14; // Loop back for further input processing
    block_24 -> block_28; // Exit from the loop

    block_28 -> block_29; // Prepare for output processing
    block_29 -> block_34; // Processing output
    block_34 -> block_40; // Check if finished output
    block_40 -> block_29; // Loop back to continue output
    block_40 -> block_43; // Exit from output processing
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Nodes**: Each node corresponds to a basic block in the IR code, labeled for identification.
- **Edges**: Directed edges represent control flow from one block to another. For example, `block_0 -> block_3` indicates that control flows from block `0` to block `3` (the entry point to the `main` function).
- **Conditional branching**: The branching statements in the IR code (like `br i1 %13, label %28, label %14`) dictate the edges between blocks.

This representation shows a simplified view of the control flow of the program, capturing the essential structure of the CFG without detailing the contents of each block. The labels can be adjusted as needed to reflect the actual block identifiers in the IR code.
