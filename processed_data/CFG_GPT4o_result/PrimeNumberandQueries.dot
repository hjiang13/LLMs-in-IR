To create a control flow graph (CFG) representation in DOT format based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will identify the basic blocks and their respective control flow connections (edges). The basic blocks will be represented as nodes, and the edges will indicate the flow of control between these blocks. Below is the DOT format for the CFG derived from the given IR code.

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="Entry"];
    block1 [label="%0"];
    block6 [label="%6"];
    block14 [label="%14"];
    block19 [label="%19"];
    block23 [label="%23"];
    block34 [label="%34"];
    block45 [label="%45"];
    block53 [label="%53"];
    block79 [label="%79"];
    block80 [label="%80"];
    block84 [label="%84"];
    block87 [label="%87"];
    block93 [label="%93"];
    block100 [label="%100"];
    block101 [label="%101"];
    block123 [label="%123"];

    // Edges
    entry -> block1;
    block1 -> block6;
    block6 -> block19;
    block6 -> block14;
    block14 -> block14; // Loop back to itself
    block14 -> block19;
    block19 -> block6; // Back to block6 for the loop
    block19 -> block23;
    block23 -> block101;
    block23 -> block34;
    block34 -> block45;
    block34 -> block123;
    block45 -> block53;
    block53 -> block100;
    block53 -> block93;
    block79 -> block80;
    block80 -> block84;
    block80 -> block87;
    block84 -> block93;
    block87 -> block93;
    block93 -> block100;
    block100 -> block53; // Loop back
    block101 -> block123;
    block123 -> block34; // Back to block34
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each basic block is represented as a node in the graph.
- The edges represent the flow of control from one block to another.
- The `label` attribute in each node represents the block identifier in the IR code.
- The graph starts from an "Entry" node, which can be considered as the entry point of the program.
- Control flow loops and branches are reflected in the edges connecting the nodes. 

You can visualize this DOT representation using graph visualization tools such as Graphviz.
