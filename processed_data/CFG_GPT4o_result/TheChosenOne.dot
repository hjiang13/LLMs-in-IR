To create a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will extract the functions, their basic blocks, and the control flow (edges) between those blocks. 

Hereâ€™s the control flow graph in DOT format based on the given IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=TB;
    
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    
    // Function: _Z3pwrxxx
    _Z3pwrxxx_entry [label="_Z3pwrxxx Entry"];
    _Z3pwrxxx_5 [label="5"];
    _Z3pwrxxx_11 [label="11"];
    _Z3pwrxxx_14 [label="14"];
    _Z3pwrxxx_21 [label="21"];

    // Function: _Z3gcdxx
    _Z3gcdxx_entry [label="_Z3gcdxx Entry"];
    _Z3gcdxx_4 [label="4"];
    _Z3gcdxx_9 [label="9"];

    // Function: main
    main_entry [label="main Entry"];
    main_14 [label="14"];
    main_16 [label="16"];
    main_18 [label="18"];
    main_32 [label="32"];
    main_39 [label="39"];
    main_42 [label="42"];
    main_45 [label="45"];
    main_54 [label="54"];
    main_59 [label="59"];
    main_72 [label="72"];
    main_76 [label="76"];
    main_79 [label="79"];

    // Edges for _Z3pwrxxx
    _Z3pwrxxx_entry -> _Z3pwrxxx_5;
    _Z3pwrxxx_5 -> _Z3pwrxxx_11;
    _Z3pwrxxx_5 -> _Z3pwrxxx_14;
    _Z3pwrxxx_11 -> _Z3pwrxxx_14;
    _Z3pwrxxx_14 -> _Z3pwrxxx_21;
    _Z3pwrxxx_21 -> _Z3pwrxxx_entry;

    // Edges for _Z3gcdxx
    _Z3gcdxx_entry -> _Z3gcdxx_4;
    _Z3gcdxx_4 -> _Z3gcdxx_9;
    _Z3gcdxx_9 -> _Z3gcdxx_entry;

    // Edges for main
    main_entry -> main_14;
    main_entry -> main_16;
    main_entry -> main_18;
    main_14 -> main_39;
    main_16 -> main_42;
    main_18 -> main_32;
    main_32 -> main_39;
    main_32 -> main_72;
    main_39 -> main_76;
    main_42 -> main_45;
    main_45 -> main_54;
    main_54 -> main_59;
    main_59 -> main_72;
    main_72 -> main_79;
    main_76 -> main_79;
}
```

### Explanation of the Graph:
- Each function is represented by its entry point and the basic blocks within it.
- The edges represent the flow of control from one block to another, indicating the paths that can be taken during execution.
- The labels in the nodes are not the actual contents of the blocks but represent their identifiers or roles in the control flow. 

This DOT representation can be visualized using graph visualization tools like Graphviz to better understand the control flow of the program.
