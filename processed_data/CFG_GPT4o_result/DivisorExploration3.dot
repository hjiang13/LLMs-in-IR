To create a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will identify the basic blocks and their connections (edges) based on the branching instructions (like `br`, `icmp`, etc.) in the code.

Hereâ€™s a simplified representation of the CFG in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    Entry [label="Entry"];
    Main [label="main()"];
    Block_5 [label="Block 5"];
    Block_7 [label="Block 7"];
    Block_13 [label="Block 13"];
    Block_17 [label="Block 17"];
    Block_20 [label="Block 20"];
    Block_27 [label="Block 27"];
    Block_28 [label="Block 28"];
    Block_41 [label="Block 41"];
    Block_46 [label="Block 46"];
    Block_49 [label="Block 49"];
    Block_52 [label="Block 52"];
    Block_54 [label="Block 54"];
    Block_56 [label="Block 56"];
    Block_58 [label="Block 58"];
    Block_63 [label="Block 63"];
    Block_67 [label="Block 67"];
    Block_76 [label="Block 76"];
    Block_94 [label="Block 94"];
    Block_102 [label="Block 102"];
    Block_135 [label="Block 135"];
    Block_140 [label="Block 140"];
    Block_154 [label="Block 154"];
    Block_157 [label="Block 157"];
    Block_160 [label="Block 160"];
    Block_170 [label="Block 170"];
    Block_184 [label="Block 184"];
    Block_234 [label="Exit"];

    // Edges
    Entry -> Main;
    Main -> Block_7;
    Block_7 -> Block_13;
    Block_13 -> Block_17;
    Block_17 -> Block_20;
    Block_20 -> Block_27;
    Block_20 -> Block_28;
    Block_28 -> Block_41;
    Block_41 -> Block_46;
    Block_46 -> Block_49;
    Block_49 -> Block_52;
    Block_52 -> Block_54;
    Block_54 -> Block_56;
    Block_56 -> Block_58;
    Block_56 -> Block_63;
    Block_63 -> Block_67;
    Block_63 -> Block_76;
    Block_76 -> Block_94;
    Block_94 -> Block_102;
    Block_102 -> Block_135;
    Block_135 -> Block_140;
    Block_140 -> Block_154;
    Block_154 -> Block_157;
    Block_157 -> Block_160;
    Block_160 -> Block_170;
    Block_170 -> Block_184;
    Block_184 -> Block_234;
    Block_67 -> Block_234;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each basic block is represented as a node (e.g., `Block_7`, `Block_13`, etc.).
- The edges (`->`) represent the control flow from one block to another based on the branching conditions and how they lead to other blocks.
- The `Entry` node signifies the start of the program, and `Exit` node signifies the end.

This representation does not include the contents of each block, as requested, only the titles of each node. You can visualize this graph using graph visualization tools that support the DOT format (such as Graphviz).
