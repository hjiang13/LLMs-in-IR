To create a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we need to extract the nodes (basic blocks) and the edges (control flow between these blocks). Below is an example of how the DOT representation of the CFG could look like, based on the structure of the IR code provided.

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes (basic blocks)
    node [shape=rectangle];
    entry [label="entry"];
    exit [label="exit"];
    block_2 [label="%2"];
    block_7 [label="%7"];
    block_11 [label="%11"];
    block_21 [label="%21"];
    block_23 [label="%23"];
    block_55 [label="%55"];
    block_62 [label="%62"];
    block_73 [label="%73"];
    block_80 [label="%80"];
    block_83 [label="%83"];
    block_86 [label="%86"];
    block_91 [label="%91"];
    block_94 [label="%94"];
    block_107 [label="%107"];
    block_145 [label="%145"];
    block_152 [label="%152"];
    block_165 [label="%165"];
    block_171 [label="%171"];
    block_174 [label="%174"];
    block_183 [label="%183"];
    block_185 [label="%185"];
    block_218 [label="%218"];
    block_237 [label="%237"];
    block_241 [label="%241"];
    block_279 [label="%279"];
    
    // Edges (control flow)
    entry -> block_2;
    block_2 -> block_7;
    block_2 -> block_83;
    block_7 -> block_11;
    block_11 -> block_21;
    block_11 -> block_55;
    block_21 -> block_23;
    block_23 -> block_23;
    block_23 -> block_55;
    block_55 -> block_62;
    block_62 -> block_73;
    block_55 -> block_80;
    block_83 -> block_86;
    block_86 -> block_91;
    block_91 -> block_94;
    block_94 -> block_107;
    block_107 -> block_145;
    block_145 -> block_152;
    block_152 -> block_165;
    block_165 -> block_171;
    block_171 -> block_183;
    block_174 -> block_183;
    block_183 -> block_185;
    block_185 -> block_218;
    block_218 -> block_237;
    block_237 -> block_241;
    block_241 -> exit;
    block_279 -> exit;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each basic block from the IR code is represented as a node in the DOT graph.
- The edges between nodes represent the possible control flow paths determined by the `br` (branch) instructions in the IR code, indicating which blocks can be executed after a certain condition.
- The `entry` node represents the entry point of the function, and the `exit` node represents the termination of the function.
- The labels for the nodes correspond to the basic block identifiers from the IR code.

You can visualize this DOT representation using tools that support the DOT format, such as Graphviz.
