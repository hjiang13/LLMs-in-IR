To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we need to identify the basic blocks and the control flow between them.

In the provided IR code, we can find two main functions: `_Z6maxXorii` and `@main()`. Each function contains various basic blocks, which we can label according to their entry points.

Hereâ€™s the control flow graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=rectangle];
    entry [label="entry"];
    block_0 [label="block_0"];
    block_2 [label="block_2"];
    block_3 [label="block_3"];
    block_5 [label="block_5"];
    block_11 [label="block_11"];
    block_13 [label="block_13"];
    block_19 [label="block_19"];
    block_end [label="block_end"];

    // Edges
    entry -> block_0;
    block_0 -> block_2; // Entry of @main()
    block_2 -> block_3; // Load stdin and freopen
    block_3 -> block_5; // Check condition with icmp (sgt)
    
    block_5 -> block_11; // True branch
    block_5 -> block_2;  // False branch (back to start)
    
    block_11 -> block_2; // Back to check condition in loop
    block_11 -> block_5; // Loop continuation

    block_13 -> block_19; // True branch from main
    block_19 -> block_end; // End of main
    block_19 -> block_13; // Loop back to block_13
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Nodes**: Each basic block has been labeled appropriately (e.g., `block_0`, `block_2`, etc.), and they represent the different control points in the functions.
2. **Edges**: Directed edges indicate the flow of control between the blocks. For example, the control flow from `entry` to `block_0`, and from `block_2` to `block_3`, reflecting the sequence of operations and branches based on conditions evaluated in the code.
3. **Loops and Branches**: The edges represent branches based on conditional checks (e.g., `icmp sgt`, `icmp ult`) which lead to different blocks depending on the evaluation of the conditions.

This representation can be visualized using graph visualization tools that support the DOT language.
