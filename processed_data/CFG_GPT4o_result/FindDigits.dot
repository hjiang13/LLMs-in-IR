The control flow graph (CFG) for the provided IR code can be represented in the DOT format. Here's the representation, focusing on the function entries and the basic blocks without detailing their content:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Node declarations
    node [shape=box];

    main [label="main()"];
    printAllDivisibleDigits [label="_Z23printAllDivisibleDigitsm(i64)"];
    entry [label="entry"];
    bb1 [label="bb1"];
    bb2 [label="bb2"];
    bb3 [label="bb3"];
    bb4 [label="bb4"];
    bb5 [label="bb5"];
    bb6 [label="bb6"];
    bb7 [label="bb7"];
    bb8 [label="bb8"];
    bb9 [label="bb9"];
    bb10 [label="bb10"];
    bb11 [label="bb11"];
    bb12 [label="bb12"];
    bb13 [label="bb13"];
    bb14 [label="bb14"];
    bb15 [label="bb15"];
    bb16 [label="bb16"];
    bb17 [label="bb17"];
    unreachable [label="unreachable"];
    
    // Edges (control flow)
    entry -> main;
    main -> bb1;
    bb1 -> bb2;
    bb2 -> bb3;
    bb3 -> bb4;
    bb3 -> bb5;
    bb4 -> bb6;
    bb5 -> bb6;
    bb6 -> bb7;
    bb7 -> bb8;
    bb8 -> bb9;
    bb9 -> bb10;
    bb10 -> bb11;
    bb11 -> bb12;
    bb12 -> bb13;
    bb13 -> bb14;
    bb14 -> bb15;
    bb15 -> bb16;
    bb16 -> unreachable;
    bb9 -> printAllDivisibleDigits;
    printAllDivisibleDigits -> bb14;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each node represents a function or a basic block in the provided IR code.
- The edges represent the flow of control between these blocks.
- The labels for each node correspond to their function names or basic block identifiers.
- The `unreachable` node indicates paths that lead to unreachable code.

You can visualize this graph using any DOT file viewer or graph visualization tool that supports the DOT language.
