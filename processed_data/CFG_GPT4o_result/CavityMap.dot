To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we will identify the basic blocks from the IR code, which are marked by labels, and then determine the edges based on the control flow instructions (e.g., `br`, `invoke`, `return`, etc.). 

Hereâ€™s the corresponding DOT representation for the CFG:

```dot
digraph ControlFlowGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="Entry"];
    main [label="main"];
    block_1 [label="11"];
    block_19 [label="19"];
    block_21 [label="21"];
    block_27 [label="27"];
    block_29 [label="29"];
    block_31 [label="31"];
    block_36 [label="36"];
    block_37 [label="37"];
    block_38 [label="38"];
    block_47 [label="47"];
    block_49 [label="49"];
    block_54 [label="54"];
    block_55 [label="55"];
    block_58 [label="58"];
    block_60 [label="60"];
    block_69 [label="69"];
    block_71 [label="71"];
    block_81 [label="81"];
    block_92 [label="92"];
    block_97 [label="97"];
    block_103 [label="103"];
    block_108 [label="108"];
    block_110 [label="110"];
    block_112 [label="112"];
    block_118 [label="118"];
    block_177 [label="177"];
    block_185 [label="185"];
    block_238 [label="238"];
    block_244 [label="244"];
    block_246 [label="246"];
    block_248 [label="248"];
    block_251 [label="251"];
    block_254 [label="254"];
    
    // Edges
    entry -> main;
    main -> block_11;
    block_11 -> block_19;
    block_11 -> block_21;
    block_19 -> block_71;
    block_21 -> block_27;
    block_27 -> block_31;
    block_27 -> block_29;
    block_31 -> block_36;
    block_31 -> block_38;
    block_38 -> block_49;
    block_49 -> block_60;
    block_60 -> block_21;
    block_60 -> block_11;
    block_69 -> block_165;
    block_71 -> block_19;
    block_81 -> block_152;
    block_152 -> block_69;
    block_152 -> block_177;
    block_165 -> block_11;
    block_177 -> block_179;
    block_179 -> block_181;
    block_181 -> block_183;
    block_183 -> block_184;
    block_185 -> block_238;
    block_238 -> block_251;
    block_244 -> block_248;
    block_246 -> block_248;
    block_248 -> block_254;
    block_251 -> block_254;

### Explanation of the DOT Format:
- Each node is represented by a box shape, and each basic block is labeled with its identifier.
- The edges represent the flow of control from one block to another, indicating where the program might jump based on conditional checks or function calls.
- The `entry` node represents the starting point of the program.

You can visualize this graph using various tools that support DOT format, such as Graphviz. This representation captures the basic flow of control without detailing the instructions within each block.
