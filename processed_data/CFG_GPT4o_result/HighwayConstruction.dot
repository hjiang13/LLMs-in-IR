To represent the control flow graph (CFG) in the DOT format based on the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we will identify the basic blocks and their connections. Each node will represent a basic block, and directed edges will represent the control flow from one block to another.

Here is the control flow graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Basic Blocks
    node [shape=box];

    // Defining nodes (basic blocks)
    BB_0 [label="0: main() entry"];
    BB_1 [label="1: Load stdin"];
    BB_2 [label="2: Check condition"];
    BB_3 [label="3: Handle case 0"];
    BB_4 [label="4: Handle case 1"];
    BB_5 [label="5: Handle case 2"];
    BB_6 [label="6: Return"];
    BB_7 [label="7: Call function"];
    BB_8 [label="8: Perform operation"];
    BB_9 [label="9: End"];

    // Connecting edges
    BB_0 -> BB_1;   // Start of main
    BB_1 -> BB_2;   // Load stdin
    BB_2 -> BB_3 [label="if true"];  // Conditional branch
    BB_2 -> BB_4 [label="if false"]; // Conditional branch
    BB_3 -> BB_5;   // Handle case 0
    BB_4 -> BB_5;   // Handle case 1
    BB_5 -> BB_6;   // End of handling
    BB_6 -> BB_7;   // Call function
    BB_7 -> BB_8;   // Perform operation
    BB_8 -> BB_9;   // End of function
    BB_9 -> BB_0;   // Exit main
}
```

### Explanation:
- The nodes (BB_0 to BB_9) represent distinct basic blocks in the function `main()` and other key parts of the code.
- The edges between nodes represent the flow of control, indicating where execution can jump based on conditions or function calls.
- The `label` attribute is used to denote the purpose of each block in a human-readable format. 

You can visualize this graph using tools that support the DOT format, such as Graphviz.
