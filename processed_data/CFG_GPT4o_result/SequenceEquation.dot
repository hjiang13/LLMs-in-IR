Here's the control flow graph represented in DOT format based on the provided intermediate representation (IR) code. The nodes represent the basic blocks, and the edges indicate the flow of control between them:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=rectangle];

    start [label="Start"];
    main [label="main()"];
    block_0 [label="Block 0"];
    block_1 [label="Block 1"];
    block_2 [label="Block 2"];
    block_10 [label="Block 10"];
    block_12 [label="Block 12"];
    block_20 [label="Block 20"];
    block_24 [label="Block 24"];
    block_27 [label="Block 27"];
    block_28 [label="Block 28"];
    block_36 [label="Block 36"];
    block_50 [label="Block 50"];
    block_51 [label="Block 51"];
    block_55 [label="Block 55"];
    block_58 [label="Block 58"];
    block_64 [label="Block 64"];
    block_69 [label="Block 69"];
    block_72 [label="Block 72"];

    start -> main;
    main -> block_0;

    block_0 -> block_12;
    block_0 -> block_10;

    block_12 -> block_28;
    block_12 -> block_20;

    block_10 -> block_27;
    block_10 -> block_20;

    block_20 -> block_24;
    block_20 -> block_72;

    block_24 -> block_28;

    block_27 -> block_72;

    block_28 -> block_36;
    block_28 -> block_69;

    block_36 -> block_50;
    block_36 -> block_51;

    block_50 -> block_72;
    block_51 -> block_55;

    block_55 -> block_64;

    block_58 -> block_64;

    block_64 -> block_72;

    block_69 -> block_28;

    block_72 -> block_20;
    block_72 -> block_27;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each node represents a basic block in the control flow graph.
- The edges represent branching and flow of control between the blocks based on the conditions and jumps in the IR code.
- The `start` node indicates the entry point of the program, leading into the `main` function.
- The basic blocks are labeled generically (e.g., `Block 0`, `Block 1`, etc.) for clarity in visualization.
- This representation can be used with tools that accept DOT format to visualize the control flow graph.
