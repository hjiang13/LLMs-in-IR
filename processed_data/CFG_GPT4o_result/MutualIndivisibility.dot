To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can identify the basic blocks and their connections based on the branching instructions (like `br`, `icmp`, etc.). Below is the DOT format representation, which includes nodes and edges:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="Entry"];
    bb_0 [label="%0"];
    bb_15 [label="%15"];
    bb_27 [label="%27"];
    bb_29 [label="%29"];
    bb_33 [label="%33"];
    bb_36 [label="%36"];
    bb_46 [label="%46"];
    bb_48 [label="%48"];
    bb_52 [label="%52"];

    // Edges
    entry -> bb_0;
    bb_0 -> bb_15;
    bb_15 -> bb_27;
    bb_15 -> bb_46;
    bb_27 -> bb_29;
    bb_27 -> bb_33;
    bb_29 -> bb_33;
    bb_29 -> bb_36;
    bb_36 -> bb_36;
    bb_36 -> bb_33;
    bb_46 -> bb_48;
    bb_33 -> bb_48;
    bb_48 -> bb_52;
    bb_48 -> bb_15;
    bb_52 -> entry;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes** correspond to basic blocks, identified by their labels (like `%0`, `%15`, `%27`, etc.).
- **Edges** represent the flow of control from one block to another based on the branching instructions in the IR code.
- The `entry` node represents the starting point of the program.

This representation captures the control flow without detailing the contents of each basic block, as per your request.
