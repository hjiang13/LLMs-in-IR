To generate the control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format from the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we will identify the basic blocks and their connections based on the control flow. Each block will be represented as a node, and the edges will represent the control flow between these nodes.

Here's a simplified representation of the control flow graph in DOT format, based on the IR you provided:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Function: main
    start [label="main Entry"];
    block1 [label="Block 1"];
    block2 [label="Block 2"];
    block3 [label="Block 3"];
    block4 [label="Block 4"];
    block5 [label="Block 5"];
    block6 [label="Block 6"];
    block7 [label="Block 7"];
    block8 [label="Block 8"];
    block9 [label="Block 9"];
    block10 [label="Block 10"];
    block11 [label="Block 11"];
    block12 [label="Block 12"];
    block13 [label="Block 13"];
    block14 [label="Block 14"];
    block15 [label="Block 15"];
    block16 [label="Block 16"];
    block17 [label="Block 17"];
    block18 [label="Block 18"];
    block19 [label="Block 19"];
    block20 [label="Block 20"];
    
    // Edges
    start -> block1;
    block1 -> block2;
    block1 -> block3;
    block2 -> block4;
    block3 -> block5;
    block4 -> block6;
    block5 -> block6;
    block6 -> block7;
    block7 -> block8;
    block8 -> block9;
    block9 -> block10;
    block10 -> block11;
    block11 -> block12;
    block12 -> block13;
    block12 -> block14;
    block13 -> block15;
    block14 -> block15;
    block15 -> block16;
    block16 -> block17;
    block17 -> block18;
    block18 -> block19;
    block19 -> block20;
    block20 -> end [label="Return"];
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each block of code in the function `main()` is represented as a node. The labels (e.g., `Block 1`, `Block 2`) correspond to the various points in the control flow.
- **Edges**: Directed edges indicate the flow of control from one block to another. The edges are added based on the branching and control statements found in the provided IR code.

This representation is highly abstract and omits the actual contents of each block. The specific labels can be adjusted based on a more detailed analysis of the actual contents of each block if needed.
