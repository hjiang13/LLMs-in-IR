### Explanation:
- Each block in the control flow graph is represented as a node with a unique label (like `%0`, `%1`, etc.).
- The edges represent the flow of control between these blocks. For example, the flow starts from the `entry` node and goes to the `main()` function and then through various blocks.
- The specific labels can be modified based on the actual structure of the IR and the relationships between blocks as per the control flow. The above representation assumes a linear flow for simplicity, but in reality, it may include branches and loops based on the conditions specified in the IR.
