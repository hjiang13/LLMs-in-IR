To create a control flow graph (CFG) in the DOT format from the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we'll analyze the control flow of the `main` function outlined in the IR code. Each node in the graph will represent a basic block, and directed edges will represent the flow of control from one block to another.

Here's the CFG based on the provided IR:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=rectangle];

    // Nodes
    start [label="Entry"];
    block0 [label="%0"];
    block19 [label="%19"];
    block22 [label="%22"];
    block30 [label="%30"];
    block45 [label="%45"];
    block54 [label="%54"];
    block70 [label="%70"];
    block71 [label="%71"];
    block75 [label="%75"];
    block78 [label="%78"];
    block84 [label="%84"];
    block91 [label="%91"];
    end [label="Exit"];

    // Edges
    start -> block0;
    block0 -> block22;
    block0 -> block19;
    block19 -> block30;
    block19 -> block91;
    block22 -> block19;
    block22 -> block30;
    block30 -> block45;
    block30 -> block91;
    block45 -> block54;
    block45 -> block45; // Loop back
    block54 -> block30; // Loop back
    block54 -> block91;
    block70 -> block84;
    block71 -> block84;
    block75 -> block84;
    block78 -> block84;
    block84 -> block30;
    block91 -> end;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each basic block is represented as a node in the graph with a unique identifier based on the IR code.
- Directed edges represent the flow of control: for instance, from `start` to the first block, and then through various branching based on conditions (e.g., `br i1` statements).
- The `Entry` node is where the function starts, and the `Exit` node represents the end of the function.
- Loops are represented by edges that connect a block back to an earlier block, indicating that control may return to that block under certain conditions.

This representation abstracts the actual content of each block and focuses solely on the flow of control through the function.
