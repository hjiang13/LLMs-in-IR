To represent the control flow graph (CFG) for the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will create a DOT format output. This will include nodes for each basic block and directed edges for the control flow between them. Below is the representation based on the IR code provided:

```dot

In this representation, each basic block is represented as a node, and the directed edges represent the flow of control between them. The nodes are labeled with their respective identifiers (e.g., `%0`, `%1`, etc.), and the `entry` and `exit` nodes represent the start and end of the control flow graph. Adjustments can be made based on the specific flow of your IR code, especially to reflect conditional branches and loops accurately.
