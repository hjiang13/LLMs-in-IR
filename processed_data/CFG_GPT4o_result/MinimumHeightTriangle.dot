To create a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format from the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we need to identify the basic blocks and the flow of control between them. Below is the DOT representation based on the analysis of the IR code you provided:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=rectangle];

    // Nodes
    start [label="start"];
    main [label="main()"];
    lowestTriangle [label="_Z14lowestTriangleii"];
    checkCtype [label="check ctype"];
    throwBadCast [label="throw_bad_cast"];
    initCtype [label="init ctype"];
    output [label="output"];
    end [label="end"];
    unreachable [label="unreachable", shape=circle];

    // Edges
    start -> main;
    main -> lowestTriangle;
    main -> checkCtype;
    
    checkCtype -> throwBadCast [label="if eq(null)"];
    checkCtype -> initCtype [label="else"];
    
    initCtype -> output;
    throwBadCast -> unreachable;
    
    output -> end;
    unreachable -> end;
}
```

### Explanation of the CFG:
- **Nodes**: Each node represents a function or a significant point in the program:
  - `start`: Entry point of the program.
  - `main()`: The main function where execution starts.
  - `_Z14lowestTriangleii`: Represents the function `lowestTriangle`.
  - `check ctype`: The block checking if `ctype` is null.
  - `throw_bad_cast`: Represents a call to throw an exception.
  - `init ctype`: Represents initialization of `ctype`.
  - `output`: Represents outputting results.
  - `unreachable`: Represents a point in the code that cannot be reached if the previous condition is true.
  - `end`: Represents the end of the program.

- **Edges**: The directed edges show the flow of control between these nodes, indicating which blocks of code can lead to others depending on conditions and function calls.

You can visualize this DOT representation using graph visualization tools that support the DOT format, such as Graphviz.
