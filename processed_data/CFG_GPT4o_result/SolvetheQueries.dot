To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we will identify the basic blocks and the edges between them based on the control flow instructions (like `br`, `ret`, and `phi`). The nodes will be named based on the labels associated with each basic block.

Here is the DOT representation of the control flow graph:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="entry"];
    block5 [label="5"];
    block6 [label="6"];
    block14 [label="14"];
    block23 [label="23"];
    block34 [label="34"];
    block172 [label="172"];
    block45 [label="45"];
    block8 [label="8"];
    block22 [label="22"];
    block80 [label="80"];
    block71 [label="71"];
    block255 [label="255"];
    block196 [label="196"];
    block302 [label="302"];
    block330 [label="330"];
    block350 [label="350"];
    block902 [label="902"];
    
    // Edges
    entry -> block5;
    block5 -> block6;
    block6 -> block14;
    block14 -> block23;
    block23 -> block172;
    block172 -> block45;
    block45 -> block8;
    block8 -> block5; // Loop back or continue
    block14 -> block23; // Branch
    block6 -> block14; // Branch
    block23 -> block34; // Branch
    block34 -> block172; // Continue
    block172 -> block45; // Continue
    block45 -> block8; // Continue
    block8 -> block22; // Branch
    block22 -> block255; // Continue
    block255 -> block196; // Continue
    block196 -> block302; // Continue
    block302 -> block330; // Continue
    block330 -> block350; // Continue
    block350 -> block902; // Final return
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Nodes**: Each basic block from the IR code corresponds to a node in the graph. I've labeled them according to their block identifiers.
2. **Edges**: The directed edges represent the flow of control from one block to another. For example, if a block branches to another block, there will be a directed edge from the first block to the second.

You can visualize this DOT file using Graphviz tools or any compatible viewer to see the control flow graph structure.
