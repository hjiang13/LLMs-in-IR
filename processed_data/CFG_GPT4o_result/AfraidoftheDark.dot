To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided intermediate representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we will identify the basic blocks and the edges that connect them based on the control flow. The nodes will simply be labeled with their block identifiers.

Here's how the output in DOT format would look:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Basic Blocks
    "Entry" -> "0";
    "0" -> "1";
    "1" -> "3";
    "3" -> "8";
    "3" -> "52";
    "8" -> "9";
    "8" -> "16";
    "16" -> "40";
    "16" -> "24";
    "24" -> "52";
    "24" -> "40";
    "40" -> "16";
    "40" -> "52";
    "52" -> "8";
    "52" -> "3";
    "52" -> "0";
    "52" -> "1";
    "12" -> "14";
    "14" -> "17";
    "17" -> "19";
    "19" -> "22";
    "19" -> "24";
    "1" -> "7";
    "7" -> "12";
    "22" -> "24";
    "24" -> "ret";
    "ret" -> "Exit";
    
    // Function Calls and Returns
    "main" -> "Entry";
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each node corresponds to a basic block in the IR code, represented by numbers for simplicity.
- The arrows (`->`) represent the control flow from one block to another, indicating the paths that execution can take.
- The "Entry" node is the starting point of the program, and "Exit" indicates the end of the program.
- The nodes (like "8", "16", etc.) correspond to the labels of the basic blocks in the IR code, but for simplicity, they are numbered sequentially.

This representation omits the actual content of the blocks, focusing instead on the flow between them as requested. You can modify the labels or add more specific names if you have further context about what each block does.
