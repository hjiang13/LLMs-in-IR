To create a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we'll identify the basic blocks and their connections based on the control flow instructions, specifically `br` (branch) instructions that determine the flow of control within the program. 

The nodes will represent the basic blocks, and the edges will represent the possible flow of control between them.

Here's the DOT representation of the control flow graph based on the provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    0 [label="entry"]
    1 [label="2"]
    2 [label="8"]
    3 [label="10"]
    4 [label="12"]
    5 [label="20"]
    6 [label="24"]
    7 [label="31"]
    8 [label="34"]
    9 [label="37"]
    10 [label="63"]
    11 [label="18"]
    12 [label="19"]
    13 [label="203"]
    14 [label="25"]
    15 [label="32"]
    16 [label="53"]
    17 [label="66"]
    18 [label="67"]
    19 [label="70"]
    20 [label="110"]
    21 [label="129"]
    22 [label="230"]
    23 [label="239"]
    24 [label="240"]
    25 [label="244"]

    0 -> 1
    1 -> 2
    1 -> 5
    2 -> 3
    2 -> 8
    3 -> 10
    4 -> 10
    5 -> 11
    5 -> 13
    6 -> 18
    7 -> 20
    8 -> 19
    9 -> 10
    10 -> 12
    11 -> 20
    12 -> 14
    13 -> 15
    14 -> 16
    15 -> 17
    16 -> 18
    17 -> 19
    18 -> 20
    19 -> 22
    20 -> 23
    21 -> 24
    22 -> 25
    23 -> 24
    24 -> 26
    25 -> 26
    26 -> 27
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each line starting with a number represents a node in the graph, which corresponds to a basic block in the IR code.
- The `label` attribute describes the basic block by its identifier.
- The arrows (`->`) represent the edges, showing the flow of control from one basic block to another based on the branches and control statements observed in the IR code.
- The entry point of the program is labeled as `entry`, corresponding to the start of the main function.
- The structure of the graph is based on the branching and control flow patterns found in the IR code you provided. 

This is a simplified overview and does not include the full complexity of the IR code. You can expand or modify it based on specific nodes or edges as required for your analysis.
