To create a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will extract the relevant basic blocks and their connections (edges) based on the branching statements. The nodes will represent the basic blocks, and the edges will represent the flow between them.

Hereâ€™s the DOT representation for the control flow graph based on the provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Define the nodes
    node [shape=box];
    Entry [label="Entry"];
    Block0 [label="%0"];
    Block10 [label="%10"];
    Block42 [label="%42"];
    
    // Define the edges
    Entry -> Block0;
    Block0 -> Block10;
    Block10 -> Block42;
    Block10 -> Block10; // Loop back to itself
    Block10 -> Block0; // Back edge to Entry
    Block42 -> Block42; // Exit block
}
```

### Explanation
- **Nodes**: Each basic block is represented as a node in the graph.
  - `Entry` represents the entry point of the program.
  - `%0`, `%10`, and `%42` represent the different basic blocks in the code.
  
- **Edges**: The arrows (`->`) represent the flow of control between the basic blocks.
  - The flow starts at `Entry`, moves to `%0`, and then to `%10`.
  - From `%10`, there is a conditional branch that can lead back to itself (loop) or exit to `%42`.
  - `%42` can also connect back to `%10`, indicating a potential return to the loop.

This representation captures the flow of control based on the branching and looping present in the provided IR code.
