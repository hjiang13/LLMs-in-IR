Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, I will analyze the control flow and generate a corresponding control flow graph (CFG) in the DOT format. Each basic block will be represented as a node, and there will be directed edges representing the flow of control between these nodes.

Here is the output in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=LR;

    // Nodes
    node0 [label="Entry"];
    node1 [label="10"];
    node2 [label="16"];
    node3 [label="21"];
    node4 [label="28"];
    node5 [label="31"];
    node6 [label="36"];
    node7 [label="80"];
    node8 [label="83"];
    node9 [label="86"];
    node10 [label="107"];
    node11 [label="113"];
    node12 [label="116"];
    node13 [label="126"];
    node14 [label="140"];
    node15 [label="141"];
    node16 [label="145"];
    node17 [label="148"];
    node18 [label="154"];

    // Edges
    node0 -> node12; // Entry to start of loop
    node12 -> node1; // From 116 to 10
    node1 -> node2; // From 10 to 16
    node2 -> node3; // From 16 to 21
    node3 -> node4; // From 21 to 28
    node4 -> node5; // From 28 to 31
    node5 -> node6; // From 31 to 36
    node6 -> node7; // From 36 to 80
    node6 -> node8; // From 36 to 83
    node7 -> node10; // From 80 to 107
    node8 -> node9; // From 83 to 86
    node9 -> node10; // From 86 to 107
    node10 -> node11; // From 107 to 113
    node11 -> node12; // From 113 to 116
    node1 -> node13; // From 10 to 126
    node2 -> node13; // From 16 to 126
    node12 -> node12; // Back to 116 (loop)
    node14 -> node15; // From 126 to 140
    node15 -> node16; // From 141 to 145
    node16 -> node17; // From 145 to 148
    node17 -> node18; // From 148 to 154
    node18 -> node9; // From 154 to 86 (end of function)
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each node represents a basic block in the CFG, identified by its label (e.g., "10", "16", etc.).
- The edges represent the control flow between basic blocks, indicating which block can be executed after another.
- The entry point of the function is represented by `node0`, and the flow starts from there.
- The `rankdir=LR` setting specifies that the graph layout should flow from left to right.

You can visualize this DOT format using any graph visualization tool that supports DOT files, such as Graphviz.
