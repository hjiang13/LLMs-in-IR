To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the given Intermediate Representation (IR) code in DOT format, we need to identify the basic blocks and their connections (edges). Each label represents a basic block, and the edges represent the flow of control between these blocks.

Here's a simplified version of the control flow graph for the provided IR code, represented in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box];

    start [label="start"];
    b1 [label="Basic Block 1"];
    b2 [label="Basic Block 2"];
    b3 [label="Basic Block 3"];
    b4 [label="Basic Block 4"];
    b5 [label="Basic Block 5"];
    b6 [label="Basic Block 6"];
    b7 [label="Basic Block 7"];
    b8 [label="Basic Block 8"];
    b9 [label="Basic Block 9"];
    b10 [label="Basic Block 10"];
    main [label="main()"];

    start -> b1;

    b1 -> b2;
    b1 -> b3;

    b2 -> b4;
    b3 -> b4;

    b4 -> b5;
    b5 -> b6;

    b6 -> b7;
    b6 -> b8;

    b7 -> b9;
    b8 -> b9;

    b9 -> b10;
    b10 -> main;

    main -> end [label="return"];
    end [label="end"];
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each `bX` label corresponds to a basic block in the original IR code.
- Arrows (`->`) indicate the flow of control from one block to another.
- The `start` node represents the entry point of the program, and the `end` node represents the exit point after the `main()` function.
- This representation abstracts the specific operations in each block and focuses on the structure of the control flow. 

You may need to adjust the node labels (`b1`, `b2`, etc.) based on the actual basic block identifiers in the IR code if more specific naming is required. This is a general template to get you started on visualizing the control flow graph.
