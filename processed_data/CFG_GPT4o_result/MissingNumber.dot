To represent the control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format based on the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we will extract the basic blocks and their connections (edges). Here is a simplified version of the CFG in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=TB;

    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="entry"];
    block_0 [label="Block 0"];
    block_20 [label="Block 20"];
    block_25 [label="Block 25"];
    block_28 [label="Block 28"];
    block_30 [label="Block 30"];
    block_32 [label="Block 32"];
    block_36 [label="Block 36"];
    block_41 [label="Block 41"];
    block_43 [label="Block 43"];
    block_48 [label="Block 48"];
    block_51 [label="Block 51"];
    block_57 [label="Block 57"];
    block_62 [label="Block 62"];
    block_65 [label="Block 65"];
    block_68 [label="Block 68"];
    block_70 [label="Block 70"];
    block_72 [label="Block 72"];
    block_74 [label="Block 74"];
    block_81 [label="Block 81"];
    block_86 [label="Block 86"];
    block_94 [label="Block 94"];
    block_97 [label="Block 97"];
    block_125 [label="Block 125"];
    block_306 [label="Block 306"];
    block_372 [label="Block 372"];
    block_394 [label="Block 394"];

    // Edges
    entry -> block_0;
    block_0 -> block_20;
    block_20 -> block_25;
    block_25 -> block_28;
    block_25 -> block_32;
    block_25 -> block_30;
    block_32 -> block_36;
    block_28 -> block_43;
    block_30 -> block_394;
    block_36 -> block_41;
    block_41 -> block_394;
    block_43 -> block_48;
    block_48 -> block_51;
    block_51 -> block_57;
    block_57 -> block_62;
    block_62 -> block_65;
    block_65 -> block_68;
    block_68 -> block_70;
    block_70 -> block_72;
    block_72 -> block_74;
    block_74 -> block_81;
    block_81 -> block_86;
    block_86 -> block_94;
    block_94 -> block_97;
    block_97 -> block_125;
    block_125 -> block_306;
    block_306 -> block_372;
    block_372 -> block_394;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Nodes**: Each block is represented as a node with a label indicating its block number.
2. **Edges**: Arrows indicate the flow of control from one block to another. The connections are derived from the control structures (like branches and invokes) found in the provided IR code.
3. **Entry Node**: The `entry` node represents the start of the program flow.
4. **Rank Direction**: The `rankdir=TB` attribute indicates that the graph should be drawn from top to bottom.

This representation simplifies the structure of the control flow graph, focusing only on the relationships between the blocks without detailing their contents.
