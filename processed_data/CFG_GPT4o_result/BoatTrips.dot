The control flow graph (CFG) for the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code can be represented in DOT format. The nodes will correspond to the basic blocks in the code, and edges will indicate the flow of control between these blocks. Here is the DOT representation of the control flow graph based on the IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=TB;
    
    // Nodes
    node [shape=rectangle];
    entry [label="Entry"];
    block0 [label="%0"];
    block1 [label="%1"];
    block2 [label="%2"];
    block3 [label="%3"];
    block4 [label="%4"];
    block5 [label="%5"];
    block6 [label="%6"];
    block7 [label="%7"];
    block8 [label="%8"];
    block9 [label="%9"];
    block10 [label="%10"];
    block11 [label="%11"];
    block12 [label="%12"];
    block13 [label="%13"];
    block14 [label="%14"];
    block15 [label="%15"];
    block16 [label="%16"];
    block17 [label="%17"];
    block18 [label="%18"];
    block19 [label="%19"];
    block20 [label="%20"];
    block21 [label="%21"];
    block22 [label="%22"];
    block23 [label="%23"];
    block24 [label="%24"];
    block25 [label="%25"];
    block26 [label="%26"];
    block27 [label="%27"];
    block28 [label="%28"];
    block29 [label="%29"];
    block30 [label="%30"];
    block31 [label="%31"];
    block32 [label="%32"];
    block33 [label="%33"];
    block34 [label="%34"];
    block35 [label="%35"];
    exit [label="Exit"];
    
    // Edges
    entry -> block0;
    block0 -> block20;
    block20 -> block21;
    block20 -> block16;
    block20 -> block33;
    block21 -> block20;
    block21 -> block16;
    block22 -> block20;
    block23 -> block20;
    block24 -> block20;
    block25 -> block20;
    block26 -> block20;
    block27 -> block20;
    block28 -> block20;
    block29 -> block20;
    block30 -> block20;
    block31 -> block20;
    block32 -> block20;
    block16 -> exit;
    block33 -> exit;
    
    // Additional edges based on the conditional branches
    block15 -> block20; // Conditional flow back to block20
}
```

### Explanation of the Graph:

- Each node corresponds to a basic block in the IR code, represented with labels such as `%0`, `%1`, etc. 
- The `entry` node represents the starting point of the program.
- The `exit` node represents the end of the control flow.
- The edges (`->`) represent the flow of control between the basic blocks, indicating where execution can jump based on conditions (e.g., branches).
- Some nodes may have multiple outgoing edges, representing different paths that can be taken based on the evaluation of conditions (like if statements).

You can visualize this graph using any DOT-compatible graph visualization tool.
