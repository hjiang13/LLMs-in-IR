To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the given Intermediate Representation (IR) code in DOT format, we will define nodes corresponding to the basic blocks in the program and the edges representing the control flow between those blocks.

Here is the DOT representation of the CFG based on the provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=TB;

    // Nodes representing basic blocks
    node [shape=rectangle];

    entry [label="entry"];
    block_0 [label="%0"];
    block_1 [label="%1"];
    block_20 [label="%20"];
    block_22 [label="%22"];
    block_27 [label="%27"];
    block_30 [label="%30"];
    block_32 [label="%32"];
    block_35 [label="%35"];
    block_43 [label="%43"];
    block_48 [label="%48"];
    block_51 [label="%51"];
    block_53 [label="%53"];
    block_55 [label="%55"];
    block_76 [label="%76"];
    block_79 [label="%79"];
    block_87 [label="%87"];
    block_122 [label="%122"];
    block_143 [label="%143"];
    block_146 [label="%146"];
    block_147 [label="%147"];
    block_151 [label="%151"];
    block_152 [label="%152"];
    block_154 [label="%154"];
    block_159 [label="%159"];
    block_160 [label="%160"];
    block_165 [label="%165"];

    // Edges representing control flow
    entry -> block_0;
    block_0 -> block_1;
    block_1 -> block_20;
    block_20 -> block_22;
    block_22 -> block_27;
    block_27 -> block_30;
    block_27 -> block_32;
    block_30 -> block_55;
    block_32 -> block_35;
    block_35 -> block_43;
    block_43 -> block_48;
    block_48 -> block_51;
    block_51 -> block_122;
    block_22 -> block_53;
    block_53 -> block_154;
    block_55 -> block_76;
    block_76 -> block_79;
    block_79 -> block_87;
    block_87 -> block_143;
    block_122 -> block_143;
    block_143 -> block_146;
    block_146 -> block_147;
    block_147 -> block_151;
    block_151 -> block_154;
    block_154 -> block_159;
    block_159 -> block_160;
    block_160 -> block_165;
    block_165 -> block_154;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each basic block is represented as a node in the graph with a unique label corresponding to its identifier in the IR code.
- The edges indicate the flow of control between these blocks, connecting the start of one block to the potential next blocks based on the control flow operations (like `br`, `invoke`, etc.) found within the IR.
- The entry node represents the entry point into the program, and it transitions to the first basic block.

You can visualize this DOT file using tools like Graphviz to see the graphical representation of the control flow graph.
