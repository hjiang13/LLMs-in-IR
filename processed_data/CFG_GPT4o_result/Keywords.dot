To represent the control flow graph (CFG) for the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we will focus on the basic blocks and their connections based on the branching and control flow statements in the IR code.

Here is a simplified representation of the control flow graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=TB;
    node [shape=box];

    start [label="start"];
    entry [label="entry"];
    block_2 [label="block_2"];
    block_14 [label="block_14"];
    block_15 [label="block_15"];
    block_533 [label="block_533"];
    block_68 [label="block_68"];
    block_75 [label="block_75"];

    block_81 [label="block_81"];
    block_86 [label="block_86"];
    block_492 [label="block_492"];
    block_508 [label="block_508"];
    block_544 [label="block_544"];
    block_550 [label="block_550"];
    block_558 [label="block_558"];
    block_400 [label="block_400"];
    block_76 [label="block_76"];
    block_31 [label="block_31"];

    block_55 [label="block_55"];
    block_62 [label="block_62"];
    block_64 [label="block_64"];
    block_67 [label="block_67"];
    block_70 [label="block_70"];
    block_72 [label="block_72"];
    block_76 [label="block_76"];
    block_79 [label="block_79"];
    block_80 [label="block_80"];
    block_81 [label="block_81"];
    block_84 [label="block_84"];

    block_92 [label="block_92"];
    block_100 [label="block_100"];
    block_111 [label="block_111"];
    block_115 [label="block_115"];
    block_116 [label="block_116"];

    start -> entry;
    entry -> block_2;
    block_2 -> block_14;
    block_2 -> block_15;
    block_15 -> block_533;
    block_15 -> block_68;
    block_68 -> block_75;
    block_75 -> block_79;
    block_79 -> block_81;
    block_81 -> block_86;
    block_86 -> block_492;
    block_492 -> block_508;
    block_508 -> block_544;
    block_544 -> block_550;
    block_550 -> block_558;
    block_558 -> block_400;

    block_400 -> block_76;
    block_76 -> block_31;
    block_31 -> block_33;
    block_33 -> block_47;
    block_47 -> block_50;
    block_50 -> block_53;
    block_53 -> block_55;
    block_55 -> block_62;

    block_79 -> block_80;
    block_80 -> block_81;
    block_81 -> block_84;
    block_84 -> block_90;
    block_90 -> block_92;
    block_92 -> block_100;
    block_100 -> block_111;
    block_111 -> block_115;
    block_115 -> block_116;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each basic block is represented as a node.
- The edges represent the flow of control from one block to another based on branches and jumps in the IR code.
- The labels of nodes represent their order of execution or unique identifiers, and are not the actual content of the blocks.
- The graph is directed, showing the flow from one block to another.

This representation captures the control flow of the provided IR code without going into the specific details of the operations within each basic block.
