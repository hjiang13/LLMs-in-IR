To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in DOT format, we will extract the basic blocks and their connections based on the branch instructions (like `br`, `icmp`, etc.). The resulting DOT file will include nodes for each basic block and directed edges for the control flow between them.

Here is the corresponding DOT representation based on the IR code you provided:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=rectangle];
    start [label="start"];
    block0 [label="0"];
    block11 [label="11"];
    block16 [label="16"];
    block41 [label="41"];
    block44 [label="44"];
    block49 [label="49"];
    block75 [label="75"];
    block82 [label="82"];
    
    // Edges
    start -> block0;
    block0 -> block11; // From %0 to %11
    block11 -> block16; // From %11 to %16
    block11 -> block41; // From %11 to %41
    block16 -> block27; // From %16 to %27
    block16 -> block28; // From %16 to %28
    block41 -> block44; // From %41 to %44
    block41 -> block49; // From %41 to %49
    block44 -> block49; // From %44 to %49
    block49 -> block75; // From %49 to %75
    block75 -> block11; // From %75 to %11
    block75 -> block82; // From %75 to %82
    block82 -> block0; // From %82 to %0 (return)
}
```

### Notes:
- Each basic block is represented as a node in the graph.
- The edges between nodes represent the control flow as dictated by the branch instructions.
- The labels on the nodes correspond to the basic block names in the IR code.
- The `start` node is added to indicate the entry point of the function, which can be assumed to transition directly into the first block (block0, labeled as "0").
- The labels in the `label` attributes of nodes are simplified to just the basic block identifiers found in the IR code (like `0`, `11`, `16`, etc.).
- The nodes and edges can be visualized using any DOT file viewer or graph visualization tool.
