To represent the control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format based on the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we will identify the basic blocks and their connections (edges) based on the branching statements (`br`, `invoke`, etc.).

Here's the simplified control flow graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=rectangle];

    // Basic Blocks (Nodes)
    block0 [label="Entry"];
    block1 [label="21"];
    block2 [label="26"];
    block3 [label="47"];
    block4 [label="28"];
    block5 [label="31"];
    block6 [label="41"];
    block7 [label="43"];
    block8 [label="75"];
    block9 [label="288"];
    block10 [label="266"];
    block11 [label="271"];
    block12 [label="277"];
    block13 [label="149"];
    block14 [label="152"];
    block15 [label="154"];
    block16 [label="157"];
    block17 [label="200"];
    block18 [label="210"];
    block19 [label="212"];
    block20 [label="235"];
    block21 [label="242"];
    block22 [label="259"];
    block23 [label="64"];
    block24 [label="31"];

    // Edges (Connections)
    block0 -> block1;
    block1 -> block2;
    block1 -> block4;
    block1 -> block6;
    block2 -> block3;
    block3 -> block4;
    block4 -> block5;
    block5 -> block6;
    block6 -> block7;
    block7 -> block8;
    block8 -> block9;
    block9 -> block10;
    block10 -> block11;
    block11 -> block12;
    block12 -> block13;
    block13 -> block14;
    block14 -> block15;
    block15 -> block16;
    block16 -> block17;
    block17 -> block18;
    block18 -> block19;
    block19 -> block20;
    block20 -> block21;
    block21 -> block22;
    block22 -> block23;
    block23 -> block24;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each `blockX` represents a basic block in the control flow, where `X` is a unique identifier. The `label` attribute corresponds to the block's title.
- **Edges**: Each arrow (`->`) represents a control flow path between blocks. Branch instructions dictate the flow from one block to another.
  
You can visualize the above DOT representation using Graphviz tools to create a graphical representation of the control flow graph.
