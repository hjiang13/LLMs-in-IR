To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided intermediate representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we need to identify the basic blocks and their connections (edges). Below is a simplified representation of the CFG in DOT format, showing only the titles of each node.

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=rectangle];

    // Basic Blocks
    start [label="Start"];
    block2 [label="Block 2"];
    block10 [label="Block 10"];
    block11 [label="Block 11"];
    block13 [label="Block 13"];
    block4 [label="Block 4"];
    block14 [label="Block 14"];
    block28 [label="Block 28"];
    block55 [label="Block 55"];
    block192 [label="Block 192"];
    block1 [label="Block 1"];
    block3 [label="Block 3"];
    block12 [label="Block 12"];
    block26 [label="Block 26"];
    block36 [label="Block 36"];
    block72 [label="Block 72"];
    block80 [label="Block 80"];
    block86 [label="Block 86"];
    block104 [label="Block 104"];
    block140 [label="Block 140"];
    block155 [label="Block 155"];

    // Edges
    start -> block2;
    block2 -> block10;
    block2 -> block11;
    block11 -> block13;
    block10 -> block4;
    block4 -> block14;
    block4 -> block55;
    block55 -> block28;
    block28 -> block192;
    block192 -> block1;
    block1 -> block2;
    block1 -> block3;
    block3 -> block4;
    block4 -> block12;
    block12 -> block26;
    block26 -> block36;
    block36 -> block72;
    block72 -> block80;
    block80 -> block86;
    block86 -> block104;
    block86 -> block155;
    block104 -> block140;
    block140 -> block155;
    block155 -> block192;
    block155 -> block55;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each node (basic block) is represented as a rectangle.
- The edges show the flow from one basic block to another, indicating the control flow.
- The labels of the nodes correspond to the block numbers or identifiers as found in the IR code, marking the beginning of each logical section in the code.

You can visualize this graph using any DOT file visualizer (like Graphviz). The structure defines the relationships among the blocks without detailing the internal content of each block, which aligns with your requirements.
