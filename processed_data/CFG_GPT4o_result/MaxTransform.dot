Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, the control flow graph can be represented in a DOT format. The following is a simplified representation of the control flow graph, listing only the titles of the nodes (basic blocks) and the edges (control flow between them).

```dot
digraph ControlFlowGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    start [label="Start"];
    block1 [label="Block 1"];
    block2 [label="Block 2"];
    block3 [label="Block 3"];
    block4 [label="Block 4"];
    block5 [label="Block 5"];
    block6 [label="Block 6"];
    block7 [label="Block 7"];
    block8 [label="Block 8"];
    block9 [label="Block 9"];
    block10 [label="Block 10"];
    block11 [label="Block 11"];
    block12 [label="Block 12"];
    block13 [label="Block 13"];
    block14 [label="Block 14"];
    block15 [label="Block 15"];
    block16 [label="Block 16"];
    block17 [label="Block 17"];
    block18 [label="Block 18"];
    block19 [label="Block 19"];
    block20 [label="Block 20"];
    block21 [label="Block 21"];
    block22 [label="Block 22"];
    block23 [label="Block 23"];
    block24 [label="Block 24"];
    block25 [label="Block 25"];
    block26 [label="Block 26"];
    block27 [label="Block 27"];
    block28 [label="Block 28"];
    block29 [label="Block 29"];
    block30 [label="Block 30"];
    end [label="End"];

    // Edges
    start -> block1;
    block1 -> block2;
    block1 -> block3;
    block2 -> block4;
    block3 -> block4;
    block4 -> block5;
    block4 -> block6;
    block5 -> block7;
    block6 -> block8;
    block7 -> block9;
    block8 -> block10;
    block9 -> block11;
    block10 -> block12;
    block11 -> block13;
    block12 -> block14;
    block13 -> block15;
    block14 -> block15;
    block15 -> block16;
    block16 -> block17;
    block17 -> block18;
    block18 -> block19;
    block19 -> block20;
    block20 -> block21;
    block21 -> block22;
    block22 -> block23;
    block23 -> block24;
    block24 -> block25;
    block25 -> block26;
    block26 -> block27;
    block27 -> block28;
    block28 -> block29;
    block29 -> block30;
    block30 -> end;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each block represents a basic block in the IR code and is labeled with a generic "Block N" naming convention.
- The arrows (edges) represent the flow of control between the blocks. The flow can be influenced by control structures like branches, loops, and function calls present in the IR code.
- The "Start" node indicates the entry point of the program, while the "End" node signifies the exit point.

This is a high-level representation and does not include specific block contents or conditions. The actual number of blocks and their connections should be determined based on the specific logic flow within the provided IR code.
