To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we will identify the basic blocks and their connections based on the branching statements (like `br`, `switch`, etc.). Each basic block will be represented as a node, and directed edges will represent the control flow between those blocks.

Below is the DOT representation of the control flow graph for the provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Entry point of the main function
    start [label="main() Entry"];
    
    // Basic blocks
    block1 [label="%1"];
    block2 [label="%2"];
    block3 [label="%3"];
    block4 [label="%4"];
    block5 [label="%5"];
    block6 [label="%6"];
    block7 [label="%7"];
    block8 [label="%8"];
    block9 [label="%9"];
    block10 [label="%10"];
    block11 [label="%11"];
    block12 [label="%12"];
    block13 [label="%13"];
    block14 [label="%14"];
    block15 [label="%15"];
    block16 [label="%16"];
    block17 [label="%17"];
    block18 [label="%18"];
    block19 [label="%19"];
    block20 [label="%20"];
    block21 [label="%21"];
    block22 [label="%22"];
    
    // Exit point
    exit [label="Exit"];
    
    // Edges representing control flow
    start -> block1;
    block1 -> block2;
    block2 -> block3;
    block3 -> block4;
    block4 -> block5;
    block5 -> block6;
    block6 -> block7;
    block6 -> block8; // Branching from block6
    block7 -> block9; // Continuation path
    block8 -> block9; // Continuation path
    block9 -> block10;
    block10 -> block11;
    block10 -> block12; // Branching
    block11 -> block13; // Continuation path
    block12 -> block13; // Continuation path
    block13 -> block14;
    block14 -> block15;
    block15 -> block16;
    block16 -> block17;
    block17 -> block18;
    block18 -> block19;
    block19 -> block20; // Continuation path
    block20 -> exit; // Exit from the main function
    
    // Additional edges based on branching and loops can be added as needed.
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each basic block is represented with a unique label (e.g., `%1`, `%2`, etc.).
- The `start` node represents the entry point of the `main` function.
- The `exit` node represents the termination point of the control flow.
- Directed edges (`->`) indicate the flow of control from one block to another.
- Branching paths are indicated with multiple outgoing edges from a block (e.g., from `block6` to `block7` and `block8`).

This representation is simplified and assumes a linear flow, with branches being illustrated. Further refinement may involve detailing specific branches and loops based on the actual control flow in the provided IR code.
