To generate a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will identify the basic blocks and their connections based on the control flow statements (branches, function calls, returns, etc.) present in the code.

Here's the control flow graph in the DOT format based on the given IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=rectangle];

    // Unwind edges
    block106 -> block230;

}
```

### Explanation:
- Each block is represented as a node in the graph.
- The edges represent the flow from one block to another based on branch instructions and function calls.
- The graph starts from the `main` function and connects through various blocks until reaching the end (block `240` and others).
- In the case of exception handling, unwind edges are indicated.
- Each node is labeled with the block identifier for clarity. 

This representation captures the control flow structure of the provided IR code in a visual format suitable for tools that can interpret DOT files.
