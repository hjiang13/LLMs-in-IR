To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we need to identify the basic blocks and their connections (edges). The nodes in the graph are the basic blocks, and edges represent the control flow between these blocks.

Here is the representation of the control flow graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Basic blocks
    node [shape=record];

    // Function _Z1sii
    block_3 [label="3: _Z1sii"];
    block_2 [label="2"];
    block_7 [label="7"];
    block_12 [label="12"];

    // Function main
    block_4 [label="4: main()"];
    block_0 [label="0"];
    block_32 [label="32"];
    block_10 [label="10"];
    block_15 [label="15"];
    block_17 [label="17"];
    block_24 [label="24"];
    block_30 [label="30"];
    block_40 [label="40"];
    block_55 [label="55"];
    block_60 [label="60"];
    block_63 [label="63"];
    block_70 [label="70"];
    block_114 [label="114"];
    block_121 [label="121"];
    block_175 [label="175"];
    block_178 [label="178"];
    block_141 [label="141"];
    block_96 [label="96"];
    block_101 [label="101"];

    // Function _ZSt16__introsort_loopIPxlN9__gnu_cxx5__ops15_Iter_less_iterEEvT_S4_T0_T1_
    block_7_7 [label="7: _ZSt16__introsort_loop..."];
    block_10_10 [label="10"];
    block_15_15 [label="15"];
    block_17_17 [label="17"];
    block_28_28 [label="28"];
    block_43_43 [label="43"];
    block_58_58 [label="58"];

    // Function _ZSt22__final_insertion_sortIPxN9__gnu_cxx5__ops15_Iter_less_iterEEvT_S4_T0_
    block_8 [label="8: _ZSt22__final_insertion_sort..."];
    block_7_8 [label="7"];
    block_9_9 [label="9"];
    block_26_26 [label="26"];
    block_21_21 [label="21"];
    block_40_40 [label="40"];
    block_44_44 [label="44"];
    
    // Edges for function _Z1sii
    block_2 -> block_12;
    block_2 -> block_7;
    block_7 -> block_12;
    block_12 -> block_3;

    // Edges for function main
    block_0 -> block_4;
    block_4 -> block_32;
    block_4 -> block_10;
    block_32 -> block_10;
    block_10 -> block_15;
    block_10 -> block_17;
    block_15 -> block_55;
    block_17 -> block_55;
    block_55 -> block_60;
    block_60 -> block_114;
    block_114 -> block_121;
    block_121 -> block_175;
    block_175 -> block_178;

    // Edges for function _ZSt16__introsort_loop...
    block_7_7 -> block_10_10;
    block_10_10 -> block_15_15;
    block_15_15 -> block_17_17;
    block_17_17 -> block_28_28;
    block_28_28 -> block_43_43;
    block_43_43 -> block_58_58;

    // Edges for function _ZSt22__final_insertion_sort...
    block_8 -> block_7_8;
    block_7_8 -> block_9_9;
    block_9_9 -> block_26_26;
    block_26_26 -> block_21_21;
    block_21_21 -> block_40_40;
    block_40_40 -> block_44_44;

    // Additional edges based on the flow
    block_4 -> block_2;
    block_2 -> block_40;
    block_40 -> block_10;
}
```

In the above representation:
- Each basic block is represented as a node with a label indicating its identifier.
- The edges are directed from one block to another, indicating the control flow from the source block to the target block.
- The function names are indicated next to their respective blocks for clarity.
