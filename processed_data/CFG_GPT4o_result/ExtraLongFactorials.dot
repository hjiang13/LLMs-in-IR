To create a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format from the given intermediate representation (IR) code, we'll identify the basic blocks and their connections based on the branch instructions (`br`) and the flow of control. Each basic block will be represented as a node, and edges will indicate the flow of control between these blocks.

Hereâ€™s the control flow graph represented in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes representing basic blocks
    node [shape=rect];
    3 [label="Entry"];
    5 [label="Block 5"];
    34 [label="Block 34"];
    7 [label="Block 7"];
    10 [label="Block 10"];
    12 [label="Block 12"];
    23 [label="Block 23"];
    32 [label="Block 32"];
    44 [label="Block 44"];
    58 [label="Block 58"];
    6 [label="Block 6"];
    1 [label="Block 1"];
    11 [label="Block 11"];
    15 [label="Block 15"];
    17 [label="Block 17"];
    20 [label="Block 20"];
    25 [label="Block 25"];
    27 [label="Block 27"];
    38 [label="Block 38"];
    42 [label="Block 42"];
    49 [label="Block 49"];
    53 [label="Block 53"];
    63 [label="Block 63"];
    16 [label="Block 16"];
    22 [label="Block 22"];
    48 [label="Block 48"];
    39 [label="Block 39"];
    40 [label="Block 40"];
    
    // Edges representing control flow
    3 -> 5;
    3 -> 34;
    5 -> 12;
    12 -> 7;
    12 -> 34;
    7 -> 10;
    10 -> 23;
    23 -> 32;
    32 -> 34;
    34 -> 6;
    34 -> 32;
    34 -> 3;
    
    5 -> 12;
    12 -> 1;
    1 -> 11;
    11 -> 15;
    11 -> 44;
    15 -> 22;
    22 -> 17;
    17 -> 38;
    38 -> 44;
    44 -> 6;
    44 -> 11;
    
    1 -> 16;
    16 -> 13;
    13 -> 53;
    53 -> 22;
    22 -> 27;
    27 -> 38;
    38 -> 42;
    42 -> 49;
    49 -> 11;
    49 -> 63;
    63 -> 1;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each node represents a unique basic block in the program.
- The edges between nodes represent the control flow, dictated by the branching statements found in the IR code.
- The labels on the nodes are for identification purposes and can be modified to fit your needs (e.g., using specific block descriptions).
- The entry point of the program is indicated at the `3` node, corresponding to the starting block of the main function.

This representation provides a clear visualization of the program's control flow, which can be rendered using tools that accept the DOT format.
