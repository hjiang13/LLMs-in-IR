To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided intermediate representation (IR) code in a DOT format, we will outline the basic blocks as nodes and the branches as edges. 

Hereâ€™s the CFG in DOT format based on the provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=box];

    entry [label="entry"];
    main [label="main"];
    power [label="powerxi"];
    seg_merge [label="seg_merge"];
    que [label="que"];
    cond1 [label="if (i32 > 0)"];
    cond2 [label="if (i32 < 3)"];
    cond3 [label="if (i32 == 0)"];
    cond4 [label="if (i32 == 1)"];
    cond5 [label="if (i32 == 2)"];
    ret0 [label="return 0"];
    ret1 [label="return 1"];
    ret2 [label="return 2"];
    ret3 [label="return 3"];

    // Edges
    entry -> main;
    main -> power;
    main -> seg_merge;
    main -> que;
    power -> cond1;
    seg_merge -> cond2;
    que -> cond3;
    cond1 -> ret0; // if true
    cond1 -> ret1; // if false
    cond2 -> ret2; // if true
    cond2 -> ret3; // if false
    cond3 -> ret0; // if true
    cond3 -> ret1; // if false
    cond4 -> ret2; // if true
    cond4 -> ret3; // if false
    cond5 -> ret0; // if true
    cond5 -> ret1; // if false

    // Additional edges based on the structure of the functions
    power -> main; // return to main from power
    seg_merge -> main; // return to main from seg_merge
    que -> main; // return to main from que
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Nodes**: Each function and significant conditional check in the flow is represented as a node. The nodes are named accordingly to indicate their function or condition.
2. **Edges**: Directed edges represent the flow from one node to another, especially the branches that lead to different outcomes based on conditional checks.
3. **Entry and Return Nodes**: The graph starts at an "entry" node and has return nodes labeled based on their return values or flow back to the `main` function.

This structure captures the essence of the control flow in the provided IR code. You can visualize this graph using tools compatible with the DOT format, such as Graphviz.
