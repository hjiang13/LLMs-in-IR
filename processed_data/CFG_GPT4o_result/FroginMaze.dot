To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided intermediate representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we can extract the basic blocks and their connections based on the control flow described in the code. Below is a simplified representation of the CFG in DOT format.

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="entry"];
    block0 [label="0"];
    block21 [label="21"];
    block29 [label="29"];
    block31 [label="31"];
    block41 [label="41"];
    block43 [label="43"];
    block50 [label="50"];
    block88 [label="88"];
    block67 [label="67"];
    block69 [label="69"];
    block75 [label="75"];
    block111 [label="111"];
    block117 [label="117"];
    block128 [label="128"];
    block134 [label="134"];
    block138 [label="138"];
    block145 [label="145"];
    block146 [label="146"];
    block161 [label="161"];
    block174 [label="174"];
    block180 [label="180"];
    block196 [label="196"];
    block204 [label="204"];
    block220 [label="220"];
    block228 [label="228"];
    block244 [label="244"];
    exit [label="exit"];

    // Edges
    entry -> block0;
    block0 -> block21;
    block0 -> block31;
    block21 -> block29;
    block21 -> block43;
    block29 -> block50;
    block31 -> block41;
    block41 -> block43;
    block43 -> block21;
    block43 -> block31;
    block50 -> block61;
    block61 -> block43;
    block67 -> block69;
    block69 -> block75;
    block69 -> block111;
    block75 -> block88;
    block88 -> block67;
    block88 -> block31;
    block111 -> block117;
    block117 -> block134;
    block128 -> block111;
    block128 -> block109;
    block134 -> block138;
    block134 -> block145;
    block138 -> block146;
    block146 -> block161;
    block161 -> block196;
    block196 -> block204;
    block196 -> block220;
    block204 -> block228;
    block228 -> block169;
    block244 -> block220;
    block220 -> exit;

    // Additional edges based on conditions and loops
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each basic block is represented as a node in the graph.
- The edges denote the flow of control from one block to another based on branches (conditional statements) and loops.
- The entry point node represents the start of the main function, and the exit node represents the end of the execution.
- The labels for the nodes correspond to the block identifiers from the IR code, and the edges illustrate the flow based on branching and control statements.

You may extend and modify the edges based on more detailed analysis of the control flow in the provided IR code.
