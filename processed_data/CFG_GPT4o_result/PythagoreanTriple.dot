To create a control flow graph (CFG) from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will identify the basic blocks and their connections based on the branching instructions (like `br` and `icmp`). Below is the representation in the DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=TB;

    // Define nodes
    0 [label="Entry"];
    1 [label="Block 1"];
    10 [label="Block 10"];
    12 [label="Block 12"];
    15 [label="Block 15"];
    25 [label="Block 25"];
    29 [label="Block 29"];
    38 [label="Block 38"];
    48 [label="Exit"];

    // Define edges
    0 -> 1;
    1 -> 10;
    1 -> 12;
    10 -> 48;
    12 -> 15;
    12 -> 25;
    15 -> 48;
    25 -> 29;
    25 -> 38;
    29 -> 48;
    38 -> 48;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each node represents a basic block or a point in the flow of control.
- The entries and exits of each block are represented by directed edges.
- The labels on the nodes (`Block N`) represent the basic blocks where the actual code processing occurs.
- The `Entry` node represents where the control flow starts, and the `Exit` node represents where it terminates.
- The edges illustrate the flow from one block to another based on conditional and unconditional branches. 

Adjustments can be made to the labels or structure depending on specific requirements or additional context from the provided IR code.
