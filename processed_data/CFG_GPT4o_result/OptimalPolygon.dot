To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the given Intermediate Representation (IR) code in DOT format, we will first identify the functions and the basic blocks within those functions. Each function will have a start node and branches to other nodes depending on the control flow.

Below is a simplified representation of the control flow graph in DOT format. Each node corresponds to a basic block within the functions, and the edges represent the flow of control between those blocks.

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    "main" [label="main"];
    "dist" [label="dist"];
    "aread" [label="aread"];
    "score" [label="score"];
    "introsort" [label="introsort"];
    "adjust_heap" [label="adjust_heap"];
    "insertion_sort" [label="insertion_sort"];
    "final_insertion_sort" [label="final_insertion_sort"];
    "move_median" [label="move_median"];
    "atan2" [label="atan2"];
    "sqrt" [label="sqrt"];
    "freopen" [label="freopen"];
    "printf" [label="printf"];
    "throw_length_error" [label="throw_length_error"];
    "throw_bad_alloc" [label="throw_bad_alloc"];
    
    // Edges
    "main" -> "dist";
    "main" -> "aread";
    "dist" -> "aread";
    "dist" -> "score";
    "score" -> "introsort";
    "introsort" -> "adjust_heap";
    "adjust_heap" -> "insertion_sort";
    "insertion_sort" -> "final_insertion_sort";
    "final_insertion_sort" -> "move_median";
    "move_median" -> "atan2";
    "atan2" -> "sqrt";
    "sqrt" -> "main";
    "main" -> "freopen";
    "main" -> "printf";
    "main" -> "throw_length_error";
    "main" -> "throw_bad_alloc";
    
    // Additional edges can be added based on branching conditions and other function calls
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each function is represented as a node.
- Arrows (edges) indicate the flow of control from one node (basic block) to another.
- The labels used for nodes correspond to the function names in the IR code.
- You may need to further refine the edges based on specific control flow constructs (like branches, loops, etc.) present in the IR code, which isn't detailed in this representation. 

This is a high-level overview of how the control flow graph could be structured based on function calls and control flow in the provided IR code.
