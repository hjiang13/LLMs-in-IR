To generate the control flow graph (CFG) in the DOT format based on the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we first need to identify the basic blocks and the connections (edges) between them based on the control flow instructions such as `br`, `switch`, and `invoke`.

Here's the DOT representation of the CFG for the given IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=TB;
    
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="Entry"];
    block1 [label="Block 1"];
    block5 [label="Block 5"];
    block7 [label="Block 7"];
    block15 [label="Block 15"];
    block19 [label="Block 19"];
    block25 [label="Block 25"];
    block29 [label="Block 29"];
    block32 [label="Block 32"];
    block39 [label="Block 39"];
    block41 [label="Block 41"];
    block50 [label="Block 50"];
    block55 [label="Block 55"];
    block60 [label="Block 60"];
    block63 [label="Block 63"];
    block68 [label="Block 68"];
    block70 [label="Block 70"];
    block76 [label="Block 76"];
    block80 [label="Block 80"];
    block83 [label="Block 83"];
    block90 [label="Block 90"];
    block91 [label="Block 91"];
    block92 [label="Block 92"];
    block101 [label="Block 101"];
    block106 [label="Block 106"];
    block110 [label="Block 110"];
    block119 [label="Block 119"];
    block126 [label="Block 126"];
    block142 [label="Block 142"];
    block150 [label="Block 150"];
    block175 [label="Block 175"];
    block189 [label="Block 189"];
    block306 [label="Block 306"];
    block311 [label="Block 311"];
    exit [label="Exit"];

    // Edges
    entry -> block1;
    block1 -> block5;
    block1 -> block70;

    block5 -> block7;
    block5 -> block19;

    block7 -> block15;
    block19 -> block25;
    block19 -> block126;

    block25 -> block29;
    block25 -> block32;

    block29 -> block121;

    block32 -> block39;
    block32 -> block41;

    block39 -> block50;
    block41 -> block50;

    block50 -> block55;

    block55 -> block60;

    block60 -> block63;

    block63 -> block68;

    block68 -> block70;

    block70 -> block76;

    block76 -> block80;
    block76 -> block83;

    block80 -> block121;

    block83 -> block90;

    block90 -> block91;
    block90 -> block92;

    block91 -> block101;
    block92 -> block101;

    block101 -> block106;

    block106 -> block110;

    block110 -> block119;

    block119 -> block126;

    block126 -> block142;

    block142 -> block150;
    block142 -> block175;

    block150 -> block306;

    block175 -> block189;

    block306 -> block311;

    block311 -> exit;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each `label` corresponds to a basic block or a significant point in the control flow represented by its name (e.g., `Block 1`, `Block 5`, etc.).
- The arrows (`->`) represent edges that show the flow of control from one block to another.
- The `entry` node represents the start of the program, and the `exit` node represents the end.
- The structure captures branching and control flow constructs such as conditional branches, loops, and function calls. 

This DOT representation can be visualized using graph visualization tools that support the DOT format, such as Graphviz.
