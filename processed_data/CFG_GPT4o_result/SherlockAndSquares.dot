Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, I've derived a control flow graph (CFG) in the DOT format. The nodes represent basic blocks, and the edges represent the flow of control between them.

Here is the DOT representation of the control flow graph:

```dot
digraph ControlFlowGraph {
    node [shape=box];

    // Nodes
    start [label="Entry"];
    block0 [label="%0"];
    block13 [label="%13"];
    block28 [label="%28"];
    block42 [label="%42"];
    block43 [label="%43"];
    block47 [label="%47"];
    block50 [label="%50"];
    block56 [label="%56"];
    block63 [label="%63"];
    block70 [label="%70"];

    // Edges
    start -> block0;
    block0 -> block13;
    block0 -> block70;
    block13 -> block28;
    block13 -> block63;
    block28 -> block42;
    block28 -> block43;
    block42 -> block70;
    block43 -> block47;
    block43 -> block50;
    block47 -> block56;
    block50 -> block56;
    block56 -> block70;
    block63 -> block28; // Loop back to block28
    block63 -> block70;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each basic block is represented as a node (`block0`, `block13`, etc.).
- The flow of control is depicted using directed edges (`->`), indicating which blocks can be entered from which other blocks.
- The `start` node represents the entry point of the program.
- The `block70` node represents the exit point, where the program will terminate.

You can visualize this graph using any DOT-compatible visualization tool, such as Graphviz.
