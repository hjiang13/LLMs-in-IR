To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided intermediate representation (IR) code in DOT format, we will identify the basic blocks and their connections based on the control flow statements (like `br`, `invoke`, `landingpad`, etc.). 

Here's the resulting DOT representation of the CFG:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="entry"];
    block0 [label="%0"];
    block1 [label="%1"];
    block2 [label="%2"];
    block3 [label="%3"];
    block10 [label="%10"];
    block21 [label="%21"];
    block23 [label="%23"];
    block25 [label="%25"];
    block27 [label="%27"];
    block29 [label="%29"];
    block47 [label="%47"];
    block58 [label="%58"];
    block63 [label="%63"];
    block109 [label="%109"];
    block114 [label="%114"];
    block115 [label="%115"];
    block116 [label="%116"];
    block118 [label="%118"];
    block121 [label="%121"];
    block129 [label="%129"];
    block133 [label="%133"];
    block155 [label="%155"];
    block166 [label="%166"];
    block226 [label="%226"];
    block238 [label="%238"];
    block253 [label="%253"];
    block276 [label="%276"];
    block323 [label="%323"];
    block354 [label="%354"];
    block396 [label="%396"];
    block439 [label="%439"];
    block402 [label="%402"];

    // Edges
    entry -> block0;
    block0 -> block1;
    block0 -> block23;
    block1 -> block2;
    block2 -> block3;
    block3 -> block10;
    block10 -> block21;
    block10 -> block23;
    block10 -> block25;
    block21 -> block47;
    block23 -> block115;
    block25 -> block27;
    block27 -> block29;
    block29 -> block47;
    block47 -> block58;
    block47 -> block114;
    block58 -> block63;
    block63 -> block109;
    block63 -> block116;
    block109 -> block115;
    block109 -> block133;
    block114 -> block115;
    block115 -> block155;
    block116 -> block118;
    block116 -> block166;
    block118 -> block121;
    block121 -> block129;
    block129 -> block133;
    block133 -> block155;
    block155 -> block226;
    block155 -> block253;
    block166 -> block226;
    block226 -> block238;
    block238 -> block253;
    block253 -> block276;
    block276 -> block323;
    block323 -> block354;
    block354 -> block396;
    block396 -> block439;
    block439 -> block402;
    block439 -> block396;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Nodes**: Each basic block is represented as a node with a label corresponding to its identifier (e.g., `%0`, `%1`, etc.).
2. **Edges**: Each directed edge represents a control flow from one block to another based on the flow control statements. For example, a branch to another block is represented as an edge connecting the originating block to the target block. 
3. **Entry Point**: The `entry` node represents the starting point of the program, which connects to the first block.

You can visualize this graph using any DOT file viewer or tools like Graphviz.
