To create a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we need to identify the basic blocks and the control flow between them. Below is the DOT representation of the CFG based on the IR code. In this representation, each basic block is represented as a node, and the control flow between them is represented as directed edges.

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=LR;
    
    // Nodes (Basic Blocks)

### Explanation:
- Each basic block in the IR code is represented as a node in the graph.
- The edges between nodes represent the control flow from one block to another.
- This is a simplified representation, and the actual number of blocks and their connections will depend on the specific structure of the IR code.
- The labels for the nodes (like "Block 0", "Block 1", etc.) are placeholders; in a real CFG, these would correspond to the actual logical blocks from the IR code.
