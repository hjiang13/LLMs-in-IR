To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided intermediate representation (IR) code in DOT format, we will identify the basic blocks and their connections based on the control flow instructions (like branches and function calls) found in the IR code.

Here's the generated DOT representation for the control flow graph:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    node [shape=record];

    // Define the nodes (basic blocks)
    main [label="{ main }"]
    entry [label="{ entry }"]
    block_0 [label="{ 0 }"]
    block_14 [label="{ 14 }"]
    block_19 [label="{ 19 }"]
    block_23 [label="{ 23 }"]
    block_34 [label="{ 34 }"]
    block_45 [label="{ 45 }"]
    block_46 [label="{ 46 }"]
    block_50 [label="{ 50 }"]
    block_53 [label="{ 53 }"]
    block_59 [label="{ 59 }"]
    block_70 [label="{ 70 }"]
    block_71 [label="{ 71 }"]
    block_75 [label="{ 75 }"]
    block_78 [label="{ 78 }"]
    block_84 [label="{ 84 }"]
    block_90 [label="{ 90 }"]
    block_91 [label="{ 91 }"]

    // Define the edges (control flow)
    entry -> block_0;
    block_0 -> block_14;
    block_14 -> block_19;
    block_14 -> block_91;
    
    block_19 -> block_23;
    block_19 -> block_34;

    block_23 -> block_19;
    block_23 -> block_34;

    block_34 -> block_45;
    block_34 -> block_46;

    block_45 -> block_84;
    block_46 -> block_50;
    block_46 -> block_53;

    block_50 -> block_84;
    block_53 -> block_84;

    block_59 -> block_70;
    block_59 -> block_71;

    block_70 -> block_84;
    block_71 -> block_75;
    block_71 -> block_78;

    block_75 -> block_84;
    block_78 -> block_84;

    block_84 -> block_90;
    block_84 -> block_91;

    block_90 -> block_91;

    block_91 -> block_0; // Return to main
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each basic block is represented as a node. The titles of the nodes show the block's identifier.
- The edges represent the control flow between these blocks, based on the branching and function calls observed in the IR code.
- The structure indicates the flow of execution and the potential paths through the program, including conditions and loops. 

You can visualize this graph using tools that support the DOT format, such as Graphviz.
