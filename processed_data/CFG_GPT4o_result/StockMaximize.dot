To represent the control flow graph (CFG) of the provided intermediate representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we will identify basic blocks and their relationships (edges) based on the control flow. Below is the DOT representation of the CFG based on the IR code provided.

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Define nodes
    node [shape=box];
    Entry [label="Entry"];
    Block0 [label="%0"];
    Block9 [label="%9"];
    Block11 [label="%11"];
    Block15 [label="%15"];
    Block18 [label="%18"];
    Block23 [label="%23"];
    Block29 [label="%29"];
    Block33 [label="%33"];
    Block35 [label="%35"];
    Block43 [label="%43"];
    Block49 [label="%49"];
    Block64 [label="%64"];
    Block78 [label="%78"];
    Block79 [label="%79"];
    Block86 [label="%86"];
    Block92 [label="%92"];
    Block131 [label="%131"];
    Block138 [label="%138"];
    
    // Define edges
    Entry -> Block0;
    Block0 -> Block9;
    Block9 -> Block11;
    Block11 -> Block15;
    Block11 -> Block18;
    Block15 -> Block64;
    Block18 -> Block35;
    Block23 -> Block29;
    Block29 -> Block43;
    Block29 -> Block33;
    Block35 -> Block23;
    Block35 -> Block18;
    Block43 -> Block64;
    Block49 -> Block64;
    Block49 -> Block49;
    Block64 -> Block78;
    Block64 -> Block79;
    Block79 -> Block86;
    Block79 -> Block131;
    Block86 -> Block138;
    Block131 -> Block138;
    Block138 -> Block11;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each node represents a basic block in the CFG. They are labeled with their respective identifiers from the IR (e.g., `%0`, `%9`, etc.).
- **Edges**: Directed edges between nodes represent the flow of control from one block to another, indicating possible paths of execution based on branching (e.g., conditional statements, loops).
- The `Entry` node represents the entry point of the function, leading to the first basic block.
- The structure follows the control flow as dictated by the branches and conditions in the IR code.
