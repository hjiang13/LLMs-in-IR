Sure! Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, I will construct a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format. The nodes will represent the basic blocks, and the edges will represent the control flow between these blocks.

Here's the control flow graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=LR;

    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="entry"];
    block1 [label="4"];
    block2 [label="22"];
    block3 [label="6"];
    block4 [label="106"];
    block5 [label="11"];
    block6 [label="17"];
    block7 [label="21"];
    block8 [label="45"];
    block9 [label="58"];
    block10 [label="63"];
    block11 [label="101"];
    block12 [label="103"];
    block13 [label="119"];
    block14 [label="114"];
    block15 [label="138"];
    block16 [label="156"];
    block17 [label="162"];

    // Edges
    entry -> block1;
    block1 -> block2; // %3 (slt) true
    block1 -> block3; // %3 (slt) false
    block3 -> block4; // %5 (phi)
    block4 -> block2; // %21 (icmp)
    block4 -> block5; // %21 (icmp) false
    block5 -> block6; // %16 (gt)
    block6 -> block7; // %20 (ult)
    block7 -> block8; // %21 (icmp)
    block8 -> block9; // %57 (and)
    block9 -> block10; // %100 (eq)
    block9 -> block12; // %121 (gt)
    block10 -> block11; // %12 (sext)
    block11 -> block5; // back to %11
    block11 -> block14; // exit from %11
    block12 -> block13; // %102 (eq)
    block12 -> block14; // %102 (not eq)
    block13 -> block16; // %161 (eq)
    block16 -> block17; // exit
    block14 -> block15; // %137 (slt)
    block15 -> block15; // back to %138
    block15 -> block16; // exit from %138
}
```

### Explanation:
- The nodes represent basic blocks, each labeled with the block's identifier (like `4`, `22`, etc.).
- The edges represent the flow from one block to another based on the conditions evaluated in the IR code.
- The `entry` node is the starting point of the execution, leading to the first basic block.
- The structure follows the flow of control as inferred from the branching statements (`br`, `icmp`, etc.) in the IR code.

You can visualize this in a graph visualization tool that supports the DOT format, such as Graphviz.
