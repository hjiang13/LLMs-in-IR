To construct a control flow graph (CFG) from the provided IR code in the DOT format, we need to identify the basic blocks and the control flow edges between them. The basic blocks start with a label (e.g., `9:`, `18:`, `20:`) and end with a branch instruction (e.g., `br`).

Below is the representation of the control flow graph in DOT format, showing the basic blocks and their connections:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Define nodes for each basic block
    node [shape=box];

### Explanation:
1. **Nodes**: Each basic block is represented as a node in the graph with a unique label.
2. **Edges**: The edges represent the flow of control from one block to another, based on the branching instructions found in the provided IR code.
3. **Node Labels**: Each node is labeled with its basic block number for easy identification.

You can visualize this DOT representation using Graphviz or any compatible tool to see the control flow graph.
