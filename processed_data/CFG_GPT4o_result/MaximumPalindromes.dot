To create a control flow graph (CFG) in DOT format from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we need to identify the basic blocks and their control flow connections. Each basic block will be represented as a node, and the edges will represent the flow between these blocks based on the branching instructions.

Here's the DOT representation of the control flow graph based on the provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    // Nodes

### Explanation:
- Each block represents a basic block in the IR code, which is identified by a unique number.
- The edges represent the flow from one block to another, based on the control flow statements (like branches and function calls) in the IR code.
- The starting point of the program is labeled `Entry`, and the first block of the function is connected to it.
- The numbering of the blocks is generic; for a more accurate CFG, each block should be analyzed for its specific content and control flow.

You can visualize this graph using tools that support the DOT format, such as Graphviz.
