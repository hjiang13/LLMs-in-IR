To represent the control flow graph (CFG) for the provided intermediate representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we will summarize the structure of the program by identifying the basic blocks and their connections based on control flow.

In the CFG:
- Each basic block will be represented as a node.
- The edges will indicate the flow of control between these blocks.

Below is the DOT representation of the control flow graph for the provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CFG {
    rankdir=TB;

    // Nodes (basic blocks)
    n0 [label="Entry"];
    n1 [label="Block 1"];
    n15 [label="Block 15"];
    n17 [label="Block 17"];
    n21 [label="Block 21"];
    n27 [label="Block 27"];
    n53 [label="Block 53"];
    n86 [label="Block 86"];
    n126 [label="Block 126"];
    n135 [label="Exit"];
    n129 [label="Block 129"];
    n133 [label="Block 133"];
    n134 [label="Block 134"];

    // Edges
    n0 -> n1;         // Entry to Block 1
    n1 -> n15;        // Block 1 to Block 15
    n15 -> n17;       // Block 15 to Block 17
    n17 -> n21;       // Block 17 to Block 21
    n21 -> n27;       // Block 21 to Block 27
    n27 -> n53;       // Block 27 to Block 53
    n27 -> n86;       // Block 27 to Block 86
    n53 -> n126;      // Block 53 to Block 126
    n126 -> n135;     // Block 126 to Exit
    n135 -> n129;     // Exit to Block 129
    n129 -> n133;     // Block 129 to Block 133
    n133 -> n134;     // Block 133 to Block 134
    n134 -> n135;     // Block 134 back to Exit
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each node represents a basic block, labeled by their block identifiers. For example, `n0` represents the entry point and `n135` represents the exit.
- **Edges**: Directed edges between the nodes indicate the flow of control. For instance, `n0 -> n1` means that control flows from the entry node to Block 1.

This representation abstracts away the details of each block while preserving the control flow structure. Make sure to adjust the node labels according to your specific requirements if you have more specific labels for each block.
