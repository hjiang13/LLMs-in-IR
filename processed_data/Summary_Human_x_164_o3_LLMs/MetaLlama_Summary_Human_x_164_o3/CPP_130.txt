This is a C++ function named `_Z3trii` that appears to be a vector resizing function, specifically designed to handle the reallocation of memory for a vector when its capacity needs to be increased. The function takes a vector and an integer as input and performs a series of checks and operations to determine the new capacity and allocate new memory if necessary.
