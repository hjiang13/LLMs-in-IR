Based on the provided LLVM IR code, I will generate the equivalent C source code. Here it is:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

typedef struct {
    char* _M_p;
    long long _M_string_length;
} _Alloc_hider;

typedef struct {
    _Alloc_hider _M_dataplus;
    long long _M_string_length;
    long long _M_capacity;
} std_string;

int prime_length(std_string* s) {
    long long length = s->_M_string_length;
    int len = (int)length;
    if (len < 2) return 0;
    if (len < 4) return 1;
    int i = 2;
    while (1) {
        if (len % i == 0) {
            if (i * i > len) return 1;
            else return 0;
        }
        i++;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Please note that the generated C code might not be perfect and could be further optimized for performance and readability. However, it should be functionally equivalent to the provided LLVM IR code. 

Also, please note that `std_string` structure in C code is a simplified representation of the actual `std::string` class in C++, as the actual implementation of `std::string` is much more complex and is typically implemented as a template class. 

In the generated C code, I've assumed that the input string's length is stored in the `_M_string_length` field of the `std_string` struct, which is a simplification of the actual `std::string` class. 

The generated C code defines a function `prime_length` that takes a `std_string*` as input and returns an integer indicating whether the length of the string is prime or not. The function uses a simple trial division method to check if the length is prime. 

You may need to modify the generated C code to fit your specific use case.
