Based on the provided LLVM IR code, I will generate the equivalent C source code. Here it is:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int multiply(int a, int b) {
  a = (a < 0) ? -a : a;
  a = a % 10;
  b = (b < 0) ? -b : b;
  b = b % 10;
  return a * b;
}
```

Please note that the generated C code is a direct translation of the LLVM IR code and does not include any additional error checking or handling that may be present in a typical C implementation.
