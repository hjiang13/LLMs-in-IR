Based on the provided LLVM IR code, here is the generated C source code:

```c
int car_race_collision(int x) {
  return x * x;
}
```

Note that I've only extracted the function definition from the IR code and converted it into equivalent C code. The function name, parameter name, and return type are all derived from the IR code.
