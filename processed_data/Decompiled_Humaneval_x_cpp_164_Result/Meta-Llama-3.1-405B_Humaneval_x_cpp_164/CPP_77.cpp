Based on the provided LLVM IR code, I will generate the equivalent C source code. Here is the output:

```c
#include <stdbool.h>

bool iscuberi(int i) {
    int abs_i = (i < 0) ? -i : i;
    int j = 0;
    while (true) {
        int j_cubed = j * j * j;
        if (j_cubed >= abs_i) break;
        j++;
    }
    return j_cubed <= abs_i;
}
```

Please note that I have only translated the provided LLVM IR code into C source code without any additional comments or explanations. The generated C code should be functionally equivalent to the original IR code. Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!
