Based on the provided LLVM IR code, I will generate the corresponding C source code. Here is the result:

```c
#include <string.h>

int is_happy(const char* str) {
    size_t len = strlen(str);
    if (len < 3) return 0;

    char last_char = str[1];
    for (size_t i = 2; i < len; i++) {
        if (str[i] == last_char) return 1;
        last_char = str[i - 2];
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Note that the generated C code is not exactly identical to the original C++ code that was compiled to LLVM IR, but it should have the same functionality. The main differences are:

* The `std::string` class is replaced with a C-style string (`const char*`) and the `strlen` function is used to get the length of the string.
* The loop is simplified to use a single loop counter (`i`) instead of the original `phi` nodes.
* The `xor` instruction is replaced with a simple `return` statement.

Please note that the generated code may not be optimal or idiomatic C code, but it should be functionally equivalent to the original LLVM IR code.
