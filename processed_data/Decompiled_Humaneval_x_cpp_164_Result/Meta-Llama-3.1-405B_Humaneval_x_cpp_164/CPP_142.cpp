Based on the provided LLVM IR code, I will generate the corresponding C source code. Here it is:

```c
#include <stdint.h>

uint32_t sum_squares(const uint32_t* data, uint32_t size) {
    uint32_t sum = 0;
    for (uint32_t i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        uint32_t value = data[i];
        uint32_t squared = value * value;
        sum += squared;
    }
    return sum;
}
```

Please note that the generated C code is based on my analysis of the provided LLVM IR code, and it may not be the only possible interpretation. Additionally, the generated code may not be optimal or identical to the original C++ code that was compiled to produce the LLVM IR. 

Also, note that the LLVM IR code seems to be using C++ standard library classes like `std::vector`, but I've replaced it with a simple C-style array in the generated C code, as C does not have a direct equivalent of C++'s `std::vector`. 

If you want me to make any changes or if you have any further requests, please let me know!
