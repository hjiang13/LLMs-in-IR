Based on the provided LLVM IR code, I will generate the equivalent C source code. Here it is:

```c
int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

Please note that the generated C code only includes the function definition, as the IR code only provides information about a single function. If you need help with anything else, feel free to ask!
