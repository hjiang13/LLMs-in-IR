After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the call graph and represented it in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];
    edge[dir=back];

    _Z20is_equal_to_sum_eveni[label="_Z20is_equal_to_sum_eveni"];
}
```

In this case, there is only one function, `_Z20is_equal_to_sum_eveni`, which does not make any calls to other functions. Therefore, the call graph consists of a single node with no edges.

If there were more functions and calls between them, the dot file would contain more nodes and edges representing the call relationships. Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to explain any part of the process!
