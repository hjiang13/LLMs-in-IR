After analyzing the provided IR code, I generated the call graph in the dot file format. Here is the result:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    label="Call Graph";

    Node1[label="is_nested"];
    Node2[label="5"];
    Node3[label="16"];
    Node4[label="21"];
    Node5[label="37"];
    Node6[label="39"];

    Node1 -> Node2[label=""];
    Node2 -> Node3[label=""];
    Node3 -> Node4[label=""];
    Node4 -> Node3[label=""];
    Node4 -> Node5[label=""];
    Node5 -> Node6[label=""];
    Node6 -> Node1[label=""];
}
```

This call graph shows the control flow between the basic blocks in the provided IR code. Each node represents a basic block, and the edges represent the control flow between them. The label on each edge is empty, as there are no function calls in this IR code.

Please note that this is a simple call graph, and the node names are based on the label of each basic block in the IR code. If you need more information or a different format, please let me know!
