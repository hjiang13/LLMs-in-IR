After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the call graph and represent it in the dot file format as requested. Here is the output:

```
digraph call_graph {
  node [shape=box, style=filled];

  "_Z18has_close_elementsSt6vectorIfSaIfEEf" [label="_Z18has_close_elementsSt6vectorIfSaIfEEf"];
  "llvm.umax.i64" [label="llvm.umax.i64"];
  "llvm.fabs.f32" [label="llvm.fabs.f32"];

  "_Z18has_close_elementsSt6vectorIfSaIfEEf" -> "llvm.umax.i64";
  "_Z18has_close_elementsSt6vectorIfSaIfEEf" -> "llvm.fabs.f32";
}
```

This call graph shows that the function `_Z18has_close_elementsSt6vectorIfSaIfEEf` calls two external functions: `llvm.umax.i64` and `llvm.fabs.f32`. The nodes represent the functions, and the edges represent the call relationships between them.

Please note that the function names are mangled, which is typical for C++ code compiled with the LLVM compiler. If you need help demangling the names, feel free to ask!
