After analyzing the provided IR code, I've constructed the call graph in the dot file format. Here it is:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box];
    _Z3addii[label="_Z3addii"];
    // No other functions are called within this module
}
```

In this case, there is only one function, `_Z3addii`, which doesn't call any other functions. Therefore, there are no edges in the graph. If there were more functions and function calls, the graph would be more complex, showing the call relationships between them. 

Note that the function name `_Z3addii` is mangled, which is typical for C++ code compiled with the `clang` compiler. The actual function name is likely `add(int, int)`.
