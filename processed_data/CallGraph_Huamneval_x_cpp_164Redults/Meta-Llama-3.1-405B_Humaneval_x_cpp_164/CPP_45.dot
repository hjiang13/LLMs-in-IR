After analyzing the IR code, I generated the call graph in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    @_Z13triangle_areaff[float, float];
}
```

Note that there is only one node in the call graph, which represents the function `triangle_areaff`. This function does not call any other functions, and there are no other functions in the IR code that call this function. Therefore, there are no edges in the call graph.

If you'd like, I can explain the reasoning behind this output or help with any further questions! 

Please let me know if you want to add more functions to the IR code to make the call graph more interesting. I can then help you to update the call graph accordingly. 

Also, I can generate the call graph in other formats if needed. Just let me know what you need! 

Please provide more IR code for a more complex call graph. I'll be happy to help!
