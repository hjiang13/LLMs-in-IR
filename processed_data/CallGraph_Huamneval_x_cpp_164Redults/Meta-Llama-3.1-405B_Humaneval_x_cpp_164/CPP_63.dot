After analyzing the provided IR code, I've generated the call graph in the dot file format. Here's the output:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    _Z6fibfibi[label="_Z6fibfibi"];
    llvm_lifetime_start_p0i8[label="llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8"];
    llvm_lifetime_end_p0i8[label="llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8"];

    _Z6fibfibi -> llvm_lifetime_start_p0i8;
    _Z6fibfibi -> llvm_lifetime_end_p0i8;
    _Z6fibfibi -> _Z6fibfibi[label="recursive call"];

    label="Call Graph";
}
```

In this call graph:

*   `_Z6fibfibi` represents the `fib` function.
*   `llvm_lifetime_start_p0i8` and `llvm_lifetime_end_p0i8` represent the `llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8` and `llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8` functions, respectively.
*   The edges indicate the function calls between these nodes. The `_Z6fibfibi` function calls `llvm_lifetime_start_p0i8` and `llvm_lifetime_end_p0i8`. Additionally, `_Z6fibfibi` has a recursive call to itself.

To visualize the call graph, you can save this output to a file with a `.dot` extension and use a tool like Graphviz to render it as an image.

Note: The basic blocks within the `_Z6fibfibi` function are not explicitly represented in this call graph. If you need to visualize the control flow within the function, I can provide the control flow graph in a separate output.
