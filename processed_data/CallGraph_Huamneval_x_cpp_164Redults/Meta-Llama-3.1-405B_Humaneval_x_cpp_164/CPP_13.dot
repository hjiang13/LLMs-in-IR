After analyzing the provided IR code, I generated the call graph in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];
    edge[dir=back];

    _Z23greatest_common_divisorii[label="_Z23greatest_common_divisorii"];
    3[label="3"];
    11[label="11"];

    _Z23greatest_common_divisorii -> 3;
    3 -> 3[label="loop"];
    3 -> 11;
}
```

In this call graph, we have three nodes:

* `_Z23greatest_common_divisorii`: the function node
* `3`: the basic block node (loop header)
* `11`: the basic block node (exit block)

The edges represent the control flow between the nodes:

* `_Z23greatest_common_divisorii` calls `3` (the loop header)
* `3` has a self-loop (representing the loop)
* `3` calls `11` (the exit block)

Note that the label "loop" on the self-loop edge is just a notation to indicate that it's a loop, not an actual label in the IR code.
