After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the call graph and represented it in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```dot
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box];

    _Z12vowels_countNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE[label="_Z12vowels_countNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE"];
    llvm_lifetime_start_p0i8[label="llvm_lifetime_start_p0i8"];
    llvm_memcpy_p0i8_p0i8_i64[label="llvm_memcpy_p0i8_p0i8_i64"];
    llvm_lifetime_end_p0i8[label="llvm_lifetime_end_p0i8"];

    _Z12vowels_countNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE -> llvm_lifetime_start_p0i8;
    _Z12vowels_countNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE -> llvm_memcpy_p0i8_p0i8_i64;
    _Z12vowels_countNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE -> llvm_lifetime_end_p0i8;
}
```

In this dot file, each node represents a function, and the edges represent the call relationships between them. The `_Z12vowels_countNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE` node is the main function, which calls the `llvm_lifetime_start_p0i8`, `llvm_memcpy_p0i8_p0i8_i64`, and `llvm_lifetime_end_p0i8` functions.

Note that the `__gxx_personality_v0` function is not included in the call graph as it is not directly called by any other function in the provided IR code.

You can use a tool like Graphviz to visualize the call graph represented in this dot file.
