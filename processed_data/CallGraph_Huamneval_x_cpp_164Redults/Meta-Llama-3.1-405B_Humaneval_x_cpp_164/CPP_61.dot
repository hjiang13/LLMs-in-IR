After analyzing the provided IR code, I generated the call graph in dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box];
    edge[dir=back];

    label="Call Graph";

    node1[label="%1"];
    node5[label="%5"];
    node8[label="%8"];
    node10[label="%10"];
    node23[label="%23"];
    node25[label="%25"];

    node1 -> node5[label=""];
    node5 -> node10[label=""];
    node10 -> node8[label=""];
    node8 -> node10[label=""];
    node8 -> node23[label=""];
    node10 -> node25[label=""];
    node23 -> node25[label=""];
    node25 -> node1[label=""];
}
```

In this call graph, each node represents a basic block in the IR code, and the edges represent the control flow between them. The label on each edge is empty, indicating that there are no function calls between the basic blocks.

Note that this is an intra-procedural call graph, as there is only one function (`_Z18correct_bracketingNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`) in the provided IR code. If there were multiple functions, the call graph would show the inter-procedural control flow between them.
