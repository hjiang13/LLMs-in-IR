After analyzing the provided IR code, I generated the call graph in the dot file format. Here is the result:

```
digraph call_graph {
  node [shape=box, style=filled];
  "_Z18car_race_collisioni" [label="_Z18car_race_collisioni"];
}
```

The call graph only contains a single node, which represents the function `_Z18car_race_collisioni`. There are no edges in the graph because there are no function calls in the provided IR code.

Note that the function `_Z18car_race_collisioni` does not call any other functions, and it is not called by any other functions in the provided code. If you provide more IR code or a complete program, I can generate a more comprehensive call graph for you.
