After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the call graph and represented it in the dot file format. Here is the result:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box];
    "_Z10below_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE" [label="_Z10below_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];
    "llvm.umax.i64" [label="llvm.umax.i64"];
    "_Z10below_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE" -> "llvm.umax.i64" [label=""];
}
```

In this call graph, we have two nodes:

1. `_Z10below_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`: This is the main function in the IR code.
2. `llvm.umax.i64`: This is a utility function called by the main function.

The edge between the two nodes represents the call from the main function to the `llvm.umax.i64` function.

Please note that this call graph only includes the functions that are explicitly called in the provided IR code. If you need to include other functions that are not explicitly called, you may need to provide additional information or context.
