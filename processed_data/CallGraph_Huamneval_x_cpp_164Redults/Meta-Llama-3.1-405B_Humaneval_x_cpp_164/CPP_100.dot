After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the call graph and represented it in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box];
    "_Z11make_a_pilei"[label="_Z11make_a_pilei"];
    "_Znwm"[label="_Znwm"];
    "_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc"[label="_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc"];
    "_ZdlPv"[label="_ZdlPv"];
    "llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64"[label="llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64"];
    "llvm.memset.p0i8.i64"[label="llvm.memset.p0i8.i64"];

    "_Z11make_a_pilei" -> "_Znwm"[label=""];
    "_Z11make_a_pilei" -> "_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc"[label=""];
    "_Z11make_a_pilei" -> "_ZdlPv"[label=""];
    "_Z11make_a_pilei" -> "llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64"[label=""];
    "_Z11make_a_pilei" -> "llvm.memset.p0i8.i64"[label=""];
}
```

In this graph, each node represents a function, and the edges represent the calls between functions. The labels on the edges are empty, as there is no specific information about the call sites.

Note that this graph only includes the functions that are directly called by the `_Z11make_a_pilei` function. If you want to include all the functions in the IR code, you can modify the graph accordingly.

Here is a brief explanation of each node:

* `_Z11make_a_pilei`: The main function that creates a pile.
* `_Znwm`: A function that allocates memory.
* `_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc`: A function that throws a length error.
* `_ZdlPv`: A function that deletes memory.
* `llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64` and `llvm.memset.p0i8.i64`: LLVM intrinsic functions for memory movement and setting.

Please let me know if you need any further clarification!
