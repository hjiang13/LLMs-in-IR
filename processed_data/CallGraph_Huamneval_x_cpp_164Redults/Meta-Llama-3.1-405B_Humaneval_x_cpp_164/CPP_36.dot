After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the call graph and represented it in the dot file format. Since there are no function calls in the provided IR code, the call graph is quite simple and only contains a single node for the `_Z9fizz_buzzi` function.

Here is the call graph in dot file format:
```dot
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    _Z9fizz_buzzi[label="_Z9fizz_buzzi"];

    // No edges since there are no function calls
}
```
However, if you're interested in the control flow graph (CFG) of the `_Z9fizz_buzzi` function, I can provide that as well. The CFG represents the flow of control between basic blocks within a function. Here is the CFG in dot file format:
```dot
digraph cfg {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    entry[label="entry"];
    bb3[label="bb3"];
    bb5[label="bb5"];
    bb15[label="bb15"];
    bb24[label="bb24"];

    entry -> bb5;
    bb5 -> bb15;
    bb5 -> bb24;
    bb15 -> bb15;
    bb15 -> bb24;
    bb24 -> bb3;
    bb24 -> bb5;
}
```
Note that the CFG only shows the basic blocks and their connections, without including the contents of each basic block.

Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!
