After analyzing the IR code, I extracted the call graph and represented it in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box];

    label="Call Graph";

    "_Z12prime_lengthNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE" [label="_Z12prime_lengthNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE"];
    "1" [label="1"];
    "6" [label="6"];
    "8" [label="8"];
    "16" [label="16"];
    "18" [label="18"];

    "_Z12prime_lengthNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE" -> "1" [label=""];
    "1" -> "6" [label=""];
    "1" -> "18" [label=""];
    "6" -> "8" [label=""];
    "6" -> "18" [label=""];
    "8" -> "8" [label=""];
    "8" -> "16" [label=""];
    "16" -> "18" [label=""];
}
```

This dot file represents the call graph, where each node is a basic block, and the edges represent the control flow between them. You can render this dot file using a tool like Graphviz to visualize the call graph.
