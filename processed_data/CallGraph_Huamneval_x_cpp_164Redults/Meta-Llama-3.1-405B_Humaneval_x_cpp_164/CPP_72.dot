After analyzing the provided IR code, I've extracted the call graph and represented it in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box];

    _Z11will_it_flySt6vectorIiSaIiEEi[label="_Z11will_it_flySt6vectorIiSaIiEEi"];
    llvm.umax.i64[label="llvm.umax.i64"];

    _Z11will_it_flySt6vectorIiSaIiEEi -> llvm.umax.i64;
}
```

This call graph shows that the function `_Z11will_it_flySt6vectorIiSaIiEEi` calls the function `llvm.umax.i64`.

Note that there is only one call edge in this graph, as the provided IR code only contains a single call instruction. The nodes represent the functions, and the edge represents the call relationship between them.

If you'd like to visualize this graph, you can use a tool like Graphviz to render the dot file as an image.
