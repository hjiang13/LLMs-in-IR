After analyzing the provided IR code, I've constructed the call graph. Since there are no function calls in the provided code, the call graph is quite simple. Here is the output in dot file format:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node [shape=box];
    "_Z6x_or_yiii" [label="_Z6x_or_yiii"];
}
```

In this graph, there is only one node, which represents the function `_Z6x_or_yiii`. There are no edges in the graph since there are no function calls.

If you'd like to visualize the control flow graph (CFG) of the function, I can provide that as well. The CFG would show the basic blocks and their connections. Let me know if you're interested!
