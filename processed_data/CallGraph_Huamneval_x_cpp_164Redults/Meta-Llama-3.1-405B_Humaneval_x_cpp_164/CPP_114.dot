After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the call graph and represented it in the DOT format. Here is the result:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box];
    "_Z14minSubArraySumSt6vectorIxSaIxEE"[label="_Z14minSubArraySumSt6vectorIxSaIxEE"];
    "12"[label="12"];
    "16"[label="16"];
    "18"[label="18"];
    "24"[label="24"];
    "32"[label="32"];
    "34"[label="34"];

    "_Z14minSubArraySumSt6vectorIxSaIxEE" -> "12"[label=""];
    "12" -> "16"[label=""];
    "12" -> "18"[label=""];
    "16" -> "34"[label=""];
    "18" -> "24"[label=""];
    "18" -> "32"[label=""];
    "24" -> "32"[label=""];
    "34" -> "18"[label=""];
    "34" -> "34"[label=""];
}
```

Note that the node names are based on the label names in the IR code, and the edges represent the control flow between the basic blocks. The label on each edge is empty, as there is no specific information to display.

Please let me know if you'd like me to clarify or modify anything.
