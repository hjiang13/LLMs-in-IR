After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the call graph and represented it in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    label="Call Graph";

    Node1[label=" _Z15starts_one_endsi"];
    Node2[label=" llvm.vector.reduce.mul.v4i32"];

    Node1 -> Node2;
}
```

In this call graph, we have two nodes:

*   `Node1`: `_Z15starts_one_endsi` (the main function)
*   `Node2`: `llvm.vector.reduce.mul.v4i32` (a called function)

The directed edge from `Node1` to `Node2` indicates that `_Z15starts_one_endsi` calls `llvm.vector.reduce.mul.v4i32`.

Note that this call graph is relatively simple since the provided IR code only contains a single function call. If the code had more functions and calls, the call graph would be more complex.
