After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the call graph and represented it in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    "_Z4fib4i" [label="_Z4fib4i"];
    "llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8" [label="llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8"];
    "llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8" [label="llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8"];

    "_Z4fib4i" -> "llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8";
    "_Z4fib4i" -> "llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8";
}
```

In this call graph, we have three nodes:

* `_Z4fib4i`: The `fib` function.
* `llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8`: The `llvm.lifetime.start` intrinsic function.
* `llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8`: The `llvm.lifetime.end` intrinsic function.

The edges represent the calls between these functions. The `fib` function calls both `llvm.lifetime.start` and `llvm.lifetime.end`. Note that there are no other function calls in the provided IR code, so the call graph is relatively simple.
