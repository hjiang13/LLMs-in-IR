After analyzing the provided IR code, I generated the call graph in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    "_Z7iscuberi" [label="_Z7iscuberi"];
    "llvm.abs.i32" [label="llvm.abs.i32"];

    "_Z7iscuberi" -> "llvm.abs.i32" [label=""];
}
```

In this call graph, we have two nodes:

1. `_Z7iscuberi`: This is the main function in the IR code.
2. `llvm.abs.i32`: This is a built-in LLVM function that calculates the absolute value of an integer.

There is one edge from `_Z7iscuberi` to `llvm.abs.i32`, indicating that `_Z7iscuberi` calls `llvm.abs.i32`.

Note that there are no other function calls in the provided IR code, so the call graph is relatively simple. If you have more complex IR code with multiple function calls, the call graph will be more extensive.
