After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the call graph and represented it in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    label="Call Graph";

    Node1[label="%1"];
    Node10[label="%10"];
    Node16[label="%16"];
    Node18[label="%18"];
    Node23[label="%23"];
    Node36[label="%36"];
    Node38[label="%38"];
    llvm_umax_i64[label="llvm.umax.i64"];

    Node1 -> Node10;
    Node10 -> Node16;
    Node10 -> Node18;
    Node16 -> Node38;
    Node18 -> Node23;
    Node18 -> Node36;
    Node23 -> Node23;
    Node23 -> Node36;
    Node36 -> Node1;
    Node38 -> Node18;
    Node38 -> Node38;
    Node10 -> llvm_umax_i64;
}
```

In this graph:

*   Each node represents a basic block in the IR code.
*   The edges represent the control flow between the basic blocks.
*   The `llvm_umax_i64` node represents the external function call.

Note that this graph does not include the contents of each basic block, only the control flow between them.
