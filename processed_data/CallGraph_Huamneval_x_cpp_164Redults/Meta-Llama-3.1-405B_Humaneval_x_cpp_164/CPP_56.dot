After analyzing the provided IR code, I've constructed the call graph. Since there's only one function in the code, the call graph is relatively simple. Here's the output in dot file format:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box];
    "_Z18correct_bracketingNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE" [label="_Z18correct_bracketingNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE"];
    "_Z18correct_bracketingNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE" -> "_Z18correct_bracketingNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE" [label="5"];
    "_Z18correct_bracketingNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE" -> "_Z18correct_bracketingNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE" [label="8"];
    "_Z18correct_bracketingNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE" -> "_Z18correct_bracketingNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE" [label="10"];
    "_Z18correct_bracketingNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE" -> "_Z18correct_bracketingNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE" [label="23"];
    "_Z18correct_bracketingNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE" -> "_Z18correct_bracketingNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE" [label="25"];
}
```

However, please note that this call graph doesn't provide much valuable information since there's only one function in the code and no external function calls.

A more useful representation would be a control flow graph (CFG) that shows the basic blocks and their connections within the function. If you're interested, I can provide the CFG in dot file format as well. Just let me know!
