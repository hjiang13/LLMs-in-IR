After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the call graph and represented it in the DOT format. Here is the result:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box,stile=filled];

    "_Z3eatiii"[label="_Z3eatiii"];
    "_Z DWC _ZNwm"[label="_Znwm"];
    "_Z__gxx_personality_v0"[label="_Z__gxx_personality_v0"];
    "llvm.memset.p0i8.i64"[label="llvm.memset.p0i8.i64"];

    "_Z3eatiii" -> "_Znwm"[label=""];
    "_Z3eatiii" -> "llvm.memset.p0i8.i64"[label=""];
    "_Z3eatiii" -> "_Z__gxx_personality_v0"[label=""];
}
```

In this call graph:

*   `_Z3eatiii` is the main function.
*   `_Znwm` is the memory allocation function (new).
*   `llvm.memset.p0i8.i64` is the memset function.
*   `_Z__gxx_personality_v0` is the personality function for exception handling.

The edges represent the calls between functions.
