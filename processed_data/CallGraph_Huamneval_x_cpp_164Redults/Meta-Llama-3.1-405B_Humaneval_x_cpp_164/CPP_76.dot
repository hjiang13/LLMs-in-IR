After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the call graph and represented it in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    _Z15is_simple_powerii[label="_Z15is_simple_powerii"];
    2[label="2"];
    5[label="5"];
    16[label="16"];

    _Z15is_simple_powerii -> 2;
    2 -> 5;
    5 -> 16;
    5 -> 5[label="loop"];
    16 -> _Z15is_simple_powerii;
}
```

In this representation, each node corresponds to a basic block or a function. The edges represent the control flow between the nodes. Note that the edge from node `5` to itself represents the loop.

To render this graph, you can use a tool like Graphviz. Save the above code in a file with a `.dot` extension and run `dot -Tpng -o output.png input.dot` to generate a PNG image of the call graph.

Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!
