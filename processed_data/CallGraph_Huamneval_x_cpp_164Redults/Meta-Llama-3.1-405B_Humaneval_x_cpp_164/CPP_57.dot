After analyzing the provided IR code, I generated a call graph in the dot file format. Here is the result:

```dot
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    label="Call Graph";

    Node_0[label="_Z9monotonicSt6vectorIfSaIfEE"];
    Node_1[label="11"];
    Node_2[label="17"];
    Node_3[label="19"];
    Node_4[label="27"];
    Node_5[label="42"];
    Node_6[label="47"];

    Node_0 -> Node_1[label=""];
    Node_1 -> Node_3[label=""];
    Node_1 -> Node_2[label=""];
    Node_2 -> Node_6[label=""];
    Node_3 -> Node_4[label=""];
    Node_3 -> Node_5[label=""];
    Node_4 -> Node_4[label=""];
    Node_4 -> Node_5[label=""];
    Node_6 -> Node_3[label=""];
    Node_6 -> Node_6[label=""];
}
```

This call graph represents the control flow between basic blocks in the provided IR code. Each node represents a basic block, and the edges represent the control flow between them.

Note that this graph does not show the contents of each basic block, only the control flow between them. If you need to see the contents of each basic block, you can refer to the original IR code.

Also, keep in mind that this is a simplified representation of the call graph, and there might be additional details or complexities in the original IR code that are not represented here.
