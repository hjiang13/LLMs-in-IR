After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the call graph and represented it in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    "_Z20right_angle_trianglefff"[label="_Z20right_angle_trianglefff"];
    "llvm.fabs.f32"[label="llvm.fabs.f32"];

    "_Z20right_angle_trianglefff" -> "llvm.fabs.f32"[label=""];
    "_Z20right_angle_trianglefff" -> "llvm.fabs.f32"[label=""];
    "_Z20right_angle_trianglefff" -> "llvm.fabs.f32"[label=""];
}
```

In this call graph, we have two nodes:

1. `_Z20right_angle_trianglefff`: This is the main function in the IR code.
2. `llvm.fabs.f32`: This is a library function called by the main function.

The edges represent the calls between functions. In this case, the main function `_Z20right_angle_trianglefff` calls the `llvm.fabs.f32` function three times.
