After analyzing the provided IR code, I've generated the call graph in DOT format. Here it is:
```
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    _Z6strlenNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE[label="_Z6strlenNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE"];

    // No other functions are called in this module, so there are no edges to draw
}
```
In this case, there is only one function, `_Z6strlenNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`, which is the `strlen` function. Since there are no other functions called within this module, there are no edges to draw in the call graph.

Note that the label for the node is the mangled function name, which can be demangled to `strlen(std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >)`. If you'd like, I can help with demangling the function names in the output. Let me know!
