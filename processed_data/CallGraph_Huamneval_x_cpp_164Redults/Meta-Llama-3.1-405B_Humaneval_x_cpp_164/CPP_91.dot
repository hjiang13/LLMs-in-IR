After analyzing the provided IR code, I generated the call graph in the dot file format. Since there is only one function in the provided IR code, the call graph is quite simple.

Here is the call graph in dot file format:

```dot
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box];
    "_Z8is_boredNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE"[label="_Z8is_boredNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE"];
}
```

In this call graph, there is only one node, which represents the function `_Z8is_boredNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`. Since this function does not call any other functions, there are no edges in the call graph.

If you would like to visualize the control flow graph (CFG) of this function, I can help with that as well. The CFG would show the basic blocks and their connections within the function. Let me know if you're interested! 

Here is the CFG in dot file format:

```dot
digraph cfg {
    node[shape=box];
    "1"[label="1"];
    "5"[label="5"];
    "10"[label="10"];
    "12"[label="12"];
    "18"[label="18"];
    "24"[label="24"];
    "26"[label="26"];
    "41"[label="41"];
    "42"[label="42"];
    "58"[label="58"];
    "59"[label="59"];
    "1" -> "5"[label=""];
    "1" -> "24"[label=""];
    "5" -> "10"[label=""];
    "5" -> "12"[label=""];
    "10" -> "26"[label=""];
    "12" -> "18"[label=""];
    "12" -> "24"[label=""];
    "18" -> "24"[label=""];
    "26" -> "41"[label=""];
    "26" -> "42"[label=""];
    "41" -> "42"[label=""];
    "42" -> "58"[label=""];
    "42" -> "59"[label=""];
    "58" -> "59"[label=""];
    "59" -> "12"[label=""];
    "59" -> "26"[label=""];
}
```

In this CFG, each node represents a basic block, and the edges represent the control flow between them. The labels on the edges are empty, as there are no conditional statements or function calls between the basic blocks. The CFG shows the structure of the function, including the loops and conditional statements.
