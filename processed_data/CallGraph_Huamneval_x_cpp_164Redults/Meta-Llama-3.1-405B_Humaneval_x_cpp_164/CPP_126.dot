After analyzing the provided IR code, I generated the call graph in the dot file format. Here it is:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box];
    "_Z9is_sortedSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"[label="_Z9is_sortedSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];
    "1"[label="1"];
    "11"[label="11"];
    "13"[label="13"];
    "19"[label="19"];
    "23"[label="23"];
    "29"[label="29"];
    "32"[label="32"];

    "_Z9is_sortedSt6vectorIiSaIiEE" -> "1"[label=""];
    "1" -> "11"[label=""];
    "1" -> "32"[label=""];
    "11" -> "13"[label=""];
    "13" -> "19"[label=""];
    "13" -> "13"[label=""];
    "13" -> "32"[label=""];
    "19" -> "23"[label=""];
    "19" -> "29"[label=""];
    "23" -> "32"[label=""];
    "23" -> "29"[label=""];
    "29" -> "13"[label=""];
    "29" -> "32"[label=""];
}
```

This call graph represents the control flow of the provided IR code. Each node represents a basic block, and the edges represent the control flow between them. Note that this graph does not include the contents of each basic block, only their titles.

To render this graph, you can use tools like Graphviz. Save this code in a file with a `.dot` extension (e.g., `call_graph.dot`) and run the command `dot -Tpng call_graph.dot -o call_graph.png` to generate an image of the graph.
