After analyzing the provided IR code, I generated the call graph in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph callgraph {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    "_Z15truncate_numberf" [label="truncate_number"];
}
```

The call graph only contains one node, which is the function `_Z15truncate_numberf`. This is because there are no function calls in the provided IR code. The function `_Z15truncate_numberf` does not call any other functions, and there are no other functions defined in the code.

Note that the label of the node is set to "truncate_number", which is a demangled version of the mangled function name `_Z15truncate_numberf`. If you prefer to keep the mangled name, I can modify the output accordingly. Let me know!
