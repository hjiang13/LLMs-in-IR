After analyzing the provided IR code, I've generated the call graph in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    _Z9prime_fibi[label="_Z9prime_fibi"];
    llvm.assume[label="llvm.assume"];

    _Z9prime_fibi -> llvm.assume;
}
```

In this call graph, we have two nodes: `_Z9prime_fibi` and `llvm.assume`. There is a single edge from `_Z9prime_fibi` to `llvm.assume`, indicating that the function `_Z9prime_fibi` calls the function `llvm.assume`.

Note that the function `_Z9prime_fibi` has multiple basic blocks, but we're only showing the title of the function as a single node in the call graph. The internal structure of the function is not represented in this graph.
