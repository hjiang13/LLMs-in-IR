After analyzing the provided IR code, I've constructed the call graph in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    label = "Call Graph";

    Node1[label="%1"];
    Node3[label="%3"];
    Node10[label="%10"];
    Node12[label="%12"];
    Node18[label="%18"];
    Node28[label="%28"];
    Node30[label="%30"];

    Node1 -> Node3[label=""];
    Node1 -> Node28[label=""];
    Node3 -> Node10[label=""];
    Node3 -> Node12[label=""];
    Node10 -> Node30[label=""];
    Node12 -> Node18[label=""];
    Node12 -> Node28[label=""];
    Node18 -> Node18[label=""];
    Node18 -> Node28[label=""];
    Node28 -> Node1[label=""];
    Node30 -> Node12[label=""];
    Node30 -> Node30[label=""];
}
```

This call graph represents the control flow between basic blocks in the provided IR code. Each node represents a basic block, and the edges represent the control flow between them.

Please note that this graph does not include the contents of each basic block, only the title of each node, as per your request.
