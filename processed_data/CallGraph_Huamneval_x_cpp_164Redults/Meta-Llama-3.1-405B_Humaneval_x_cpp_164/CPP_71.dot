After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the call graph and represented it in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box];
    "_Z13triangle_areafff"[label="_Z13triangle_areafff"];
    "pow"[label="pow"];
    "_Z13triangle_areafff" -> "pow"[label=""];
}
```

In this call graph, we have two nodes:

*   `_Z13triangle_areafff`: represents the function with the mangled name `_Z13triangle_areafff`, which takes three float arguments and returns a float value.
*   `pow`: represents the declared function `pow`, which takes two double arguments and returns a double value.

There is a directed edge from `_Z13triangle_areafff` to `pow`, indicating that `_Z13triangle_areafff` calls `pow` during its execution.
