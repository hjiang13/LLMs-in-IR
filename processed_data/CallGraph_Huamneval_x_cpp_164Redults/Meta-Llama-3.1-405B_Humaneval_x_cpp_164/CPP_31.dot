After analyzing the provided IR code, I generated the call graph in the dot file format. Since there is only one function `_Z8is_primex` and no other function calls, the call graph is quite simple.

Here is the output:
```
digraph CallGraph {
    node [shape=box, style=filled];
    "_Z8is_primex" [label="_Z8is_primex"];
}
```
In this output, we have a single node representing the function `_Z8is_primex`. There are no edges in the graph since there are no function calls.

If you'd like to visualize the control flow graph (CFG) within the function, I can provide that as well. Please let me know!
