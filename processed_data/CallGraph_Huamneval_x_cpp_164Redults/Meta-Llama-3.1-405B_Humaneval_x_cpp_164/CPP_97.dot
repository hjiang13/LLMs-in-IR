After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the call graph and represented it in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    "_Z8multiplyii" [label="_Z8multiplyii"];
    "llvm.abs.i32" [label="llvm.abs.i32"];

    "_Z8multiplyii" -> "llvm.abs.i32" [label=""];
    "_Z8multiplyii" -> "llvm.abs.i32" [label=""];
}
```

In this call graph, we have two nodes: `_Z8multiplyii` and `llvm.abs.i32`. The edges represent the calls between these functions. The `_Z8multiplyii` function calls `llvm.abs.i32` twice.

Please note that the IR code appears to be generated by LLVM, and the function names are mangled. If you'd like, I can try to demangle the function names for better readability. Let me know!
