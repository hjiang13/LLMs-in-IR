After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the call graph and represented it in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box];
    "_Z19triples_sum_to_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"[label="_Z19triples_sum_to_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];
    "llvm.umax.i64"[label="llvm.umax.i64"];
    "_Z19triples_sum_to_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE" -> "llvm.umax.i64";
}
```

The call graph consists of two nodes: `_Z19triples_sum_to_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` and `llvm.umax.i64`. There is a directed edge from `_Z19triples_sum_to_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` to `llvm.umax.i64`, indicating that the former function calls the latter.

Note that the node labels are the function names, and the edge represents the call relationship between them.

Here is a brief explanation of the graph:

* `_Z19triples_sum_to_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` is the main function, which calls `llvm.umax.i64`.
* `llvm.umax.i64` is a utility function that returns the maximum of two i64 values.

Please let me know if you need further clarification or details!
