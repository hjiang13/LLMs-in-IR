After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the call graph and represented it in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    label="Call Graph";

    Node1[label="_Z12intersectionB5cxx11St6vectorIiSaIiEES1_"];
    Node2[label="llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64"];
    Node3[label="__gxx_personality_v0"];

    Node1 -> Node2;
    Node1 -> Node3;
}
```

In this call graph:

*   Node1 represents the function `_Z12intersectionB5cxx11St6vectorIiSaIiEES1_`, which is the main function in the provided IR code.
*   Node2 represents the function `llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64`, which is called by the main function.
*   Node3 represents the function `__gxx_personality_v0`, which is also called by the main function.

The edges in the graph represent the call relationships between these functions. The main function calls both `llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64` and `__gxx_personality_v0`.
