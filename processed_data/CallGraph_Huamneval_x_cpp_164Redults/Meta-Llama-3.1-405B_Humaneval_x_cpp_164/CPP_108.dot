After analyzing the provided IR code, I generated the call graph in the dot file format. Here is the result:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box];
    edge[dir=back];

    label="Call Graph";

    node1[label="llvm.umax.i64"];
    node2[label="_Z10count_numsSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];

    node2 -> node1[label="calls"];
}
```

In this call graph, we have two nodes:

1. `llvm.umax.i64`: This is a declared function in the IR code, which is a part of the LLVM standard library.
2. `_Z10count_numsSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`: This is the defined function in the IR code, which is the main function of interest.

There is one edge between these two nodes, indicating that `_Z10count_numsSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` calls `llvm.umax.i64`.

Please note that this call graph only includes the functions present in the provided IR code. If there are other functions called by `_Z10count_numsSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` that are not defined in this IR code, they will not be included in this call graph.
