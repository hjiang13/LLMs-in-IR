After analyzing the provided IR code, I generated the call graph in the dot file format. Since there is only one function in the provided IR code, the call graph is relatively simple.

Here is the call graph in dot file format:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box];
    "_Z30check_if_last_char_is_a_letterNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE" [label="_Z30check_if_last_char_is_a_letterNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE"];
}
```

However, if we consider the basic blocks as nodes, the graph would be more complex. Here is the graph with basic blocks as nodes:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box];
    "1" [label="1"];
    "5" [label="5"];
    "12" [label="12"];
    "14" [label="14"];
    "16" [label="16"];
    "22" [label="22"];
    "25" [label="25"];
    "31" [label="31"];
    "1" -> "5" [label=""];
    "1" -> "31" [label=""];
    "5" -> "12" [label=""];
    "5" -> "31" [label=""];
    "12" -> "14" [label=""];
    "12" -> "25" [label=""];
    "14" -> "16" [label=""];
    "14" -> "31" [label=""];
    "16" -> "22" [label=""];
    "16" -> "31" [label=""];
    "22" -> "31" [label=""];
    "25" -> "14" [label=""];
    "25" -> "31" [label=""];
}
```

This graph shows the control flow between basic blocks. Each node represents a basic block, and each edge represents a possible control flow between basic blocks.
