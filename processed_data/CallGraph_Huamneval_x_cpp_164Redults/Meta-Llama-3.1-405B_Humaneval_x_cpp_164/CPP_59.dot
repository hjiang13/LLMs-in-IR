After analyzing the provided IR code, I generated the call graph in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node [shape=box];
    label="Call Graph";

    node1 [label="_Z20largest_prime_factori"];
    node2 [label="3"];
    node3 [label="10"];
    node4 [label="12"];
    node5 [label="19"];

    node1 -> node2 [label=""];
    node1 -> node3 [label=""];
    node2 -> node4 [label=""];
    node2 -> node5 [label=""];
    node4 -> node4 [label=""];
    node4 -> node5 [label=""];
    node5 -> node2 [label=""];
    node5 -> node3 [label=""];
}
```

Note that the graph only includes the basic block titles as nodes, and the edges represent the control flow between them. The edge labels are empty since there are no function calls in the provided IR code.

Please let me know if you have any further requests or questions!
