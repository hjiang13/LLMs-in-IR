After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the call graph and represented it in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    "_Z8sum_to_ni" [label="_Z8sum_to_ni"];

    "_Z8sum_to_ni" -> "_Z8sum_to_ni" [label=""];

}
```

However, since there is only one function in the provided IR code, the call graph only contains a single node with no edges. The function `_Z8sum_to_ni` does not call any other functions, and it is not called by any other functions within this module.

If you provide more IR code with multiple functions, I can help you generate a more complex call graph.
