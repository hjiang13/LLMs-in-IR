After analyzing the IR code, I extracted the call graph and represented it in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph CallGraph {
    node[shape=box];

    "_Z17pairs_sum_to_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE" [label="pairs_sum_to_zero"];
    "llvm.umax.i64" [label="llvm.umax.i64"];

    "_Z17pairs_sum_to_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE" -> "llvm.umax.i64";
}
```

In this call graph, there are two nodes:

*   `_Z17pairs_sum_to_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` ( pairs_sum_to_zero )
*   `llvm.umax.i64`

The edge represents the call from `pairs_sum_to_zero` to `llvm.umax.i64`.

Note that this call graph only includes the function calls and does not represent the control flow within the functions. If you need more detailed information, please let me know. 

However, if we consider the basic blocks as nodes, the call graph will be more complex and will include the following nodes:

*   `_Z17pairs_sum_to_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`
*   `1`
*   `11`
*   `13`
*   `16`
*   `22`
*   `25`
*   `27`
*   `34`
*   `llvm.umax.i64`

And the edges will represent the control flow between these basic blocks. Here is the updated call graph:

```
digraph CallGraph {
    node[shape=box];

    "_Z17pairs_sum_to_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE" [label="pairs_sum_to_zero"];
    "1" [label="1"];
    "11" [label="11"];
    "13" [label="13"];
    "16" [label="16"];
    "22" [label="22"];
    "25" [label="25"];
    "27" [label="27"];
    "34" [label="34"];
    "llvm.umax.i64" [label="llvm.umax.i64"];

    "_Z17pairs_sum_to_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE" -> "1";
    "1" -> "11";
    "1" -> "34";
    "11" -> "16";
    "13" -> "16";
    "13" -> "34";
    "16" -> "13";
    "16" -> "22";
    "16" -> "25";
    "22" -> "27";
    "25" -> "13";
    "25" -> "27";
    "27" -> "25";
    "27" -> "34";
    "11" -> "llvm.umax.i64";
}
```

This call graph represents the control flow between the basic blocks in the `pairs_sum_to_zero` function. Note that this graph is more complex and may not be suitable for all use cases.
