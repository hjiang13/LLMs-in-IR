After analyzing the provided IR code, I extracted the call graph and represented it in the dot file format. Here is the output:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box];
    "_Z4modpii"[label="_Z4modpii"];
    "2"[label="2"];
    "4"[label="4"];
    "8"[label="8"];
    "10"[label="10"];
    "14"[label="14"];
    "21"[label="21"];
    "23"[label="23"];

    "_Z4modpii" -> "2"[label=""];
    "2" -> "4"[label=""];
    "2" -> "21"[label=""];
    "4" -> "8"[label=""];
    "4" -> "10"[label=""];
    "8" -> "23"[label=""];
    "10" -> "14"[label=""];
    "10" -> "21"[label=""];
    "14" -> "14"[label=""];
    "14" -> "21"[label=""];
    "21" -> "_Z4modpii"[label=""];
    "23" -> "10"[label=""];
    "23" -> "23"[label=""];
}
```

This call graph shows the control flow between the basic blocks in the `_Z4modpii` function. The nodes represent the basic blocks, and the edges represent the control flow between them.

Note that this is a simplified representation of the call graph, as it does not include the contents of each basic block or any additional information. If you need a more detailed representation, please let me know.
