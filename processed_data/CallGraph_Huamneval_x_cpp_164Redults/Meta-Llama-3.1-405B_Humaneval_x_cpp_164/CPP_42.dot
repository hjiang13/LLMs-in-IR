After analyzing the provided IR code, I've extracted the call graph in the dot file format. Here it is:

```
digraph call_graph {
    node[shape=box, style=filled];

    label="Call Graph";

    EntryPoint[label="incr_list"];
    llvm_umax_i64[label="llvm.umax.i64"];
    llvm_memset_p0i8_i64[label="llvm.memset.p0i8.i64"];

    EntryPoint -> llvm_umax_i64;
    EntryPoint -> llvm_memset_p0i8_i64;

    BB2[label="BB2"];
    BB11[label="BB11"];
    BB15[label="BB15"];
    BB22[label="BB22"];
    BB24[label="BB24"];
    BB51[label="BB51"];
    BB54[label="BB54"];
    BB65[label="BB65"];
    BB67[label="BB67"];
    BB69[label="BB69"];
    BB76[label="BB76"];

    EntryPoint -> BB2;
    BB2 -> BB11;
    BB2 -> BB69;
    BB11 -> BB15;
    BB11 -> BB67;
    BB15 -> BB22;
    BB15 -> BB51;
    BB22 -> BB24;
    BB24 -> BB24;
    BB24 -> BB51;
    BB51 -> BB54;
    BB51 -> BB65;
    BB54 -> BB65;
    BB65 -> BB69;
    BB65 -> BB67;
    BB67 -> BB76;
    BB76 -> BB76;
    BB76 -> BB69;
}
```

Please note that I've only included the basic block titles as nodes, without listing their contents. The edges represent the control flow between the basic blocks. The `llvm.umax.i64` and `llvm.memset.p0i8.i64` nodes represent the external function calls.

You can render this dot file using Graphviz to visualize the call graph.
