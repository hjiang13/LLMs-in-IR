Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can analyze the function definitions and their control flow to construct a call graph. In this case, the only function defined is `largest_divisor`.

Here is the call graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    "largest_divisor(i32)" [label="largest_divisor(i32)"];

    // Edges
    // No calls to other functions are present in the provided IR code, so there are no edges.
}
```

### Explanation:
- The function `largest_divisor` is defined in the IR code, and it is the only function present, so it is the only node in the graph.
- Since there are no calls to other functions within the provided code, there are no edges connecting to other nodes. 

This call graph representation is minimal due to the single function in the provided IR code. If there were additional functions with calls to each other, they would also be included in the nodes and edges.
