Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, the call graph can be represented in the DOT format. The nodes will represent the functions defined or declared in the code, and the edges will represent the calls made between them. Below is the generated DOT representation of the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    
    // Function Definitions
    _Z12get_positiveSt6vectorIfSaIfEE [label="_Z12get_positiveSt6vectorIfSaIfEE"];
    
    // Function Declarations
    @__gxx_personality_v0 [label="__gxx_personality_v0"];
    _ZdlPv [label="_ZdlPv"];
    _ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc [label="_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc"];
    _Znwm [label="_Znwm"];
    @llvm.memset.p0i8.i64 [label="llvm.memset.p0i8.i64"];
    @llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64 [label="llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64"];
    
    // Edges (Function Calls)
    _Z12get_positiveSt6vectorIfSaIfEE -> @llvm.memset.p0i8.i64;
    _Z12get_positiveSt6vectorIfSaIfEE -> _ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc;
    _Z12get_positiveSt6vectorIfSaIfEE -> _ZdlPv;
    _Z12get_positiveSt6vectorIfSaIfEE -> _Znwm;
    _Z12get_positiveSt6vectorIfSaIfEE -> @llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each function is represented as a node in the graph.
- The edges indicate the calls made to other functions from the function `_Z12get_positiveSt6vectorIfSaIfEE`.
- The nodes are labeled with the respective function names, and the calls from the function are directed towards the called functions. 

You can visualize this DOT representation using a tool like Graphviz to see the call graph visually.
