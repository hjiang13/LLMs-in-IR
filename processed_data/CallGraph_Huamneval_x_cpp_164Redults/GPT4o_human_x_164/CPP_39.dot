Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can extract the functions and their calls to create a call graph in the DOT format. 

Here's the DOT representation of the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    _Z9prime_fibi [label="_Z9prime_fibi"];
    llvm.assume [label="@llvm.assume"];

    // Edges
    _Z9prime_fibi -> llvm.assume;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: We have two nodes in the call graph:
  - `_Z9prime_fibi`: This is the main function defined in the IR code.
  - `llvm.assume`: This is a function that is called within `_Z9prime_fibi`.

- **Edges**: There is a directed edge from `_Z9prime_fibi` to `llvm.assume`, indicating that `_Z9prime_fibi` calls `llvm.assume`. 

This representation captures the relationships between the functions as specified in the IR code.
