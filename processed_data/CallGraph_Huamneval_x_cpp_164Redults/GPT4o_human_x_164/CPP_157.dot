Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can identify the functions and their calls to generate a call graph in the DOT format. Here's the call graph representation:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Define nodes
    node [shape=box];

    // Function nodes
    right_angle_triangle [label="_Z20right_angle_trianglefff"];
    llvm_fabs_f32 [label="llvm.fabs.f32"];

    // Define edges (function calls)
    right_angle_triangle -> llvm_fabs_f32;
    right_angle_triangle -> llvm_fabs_f32; // Called multiple times
    right_angle_triangle -> llvm_fabs_f32; // Called multiple times
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each function is represented as a node in the graph. The function `_Z20right_angle_trianglefff` corresponds to the defined function, and `llvm.fabs.f32` corresponds to the declared function used within it.
- **Edges**: Directed edges from the calling function (`right_angle_triangle`) to the called function (`llvm_fabs_f32`) are established to represent the function calls.

This is a simplified representation, where the focus is on the function calls rather than the internal structure of the functions.
