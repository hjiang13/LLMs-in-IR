Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can analyze the function calls and their relationships to create a call graph. Hereâ€™s the dot file representation of the call graph, including nodes for the function defined and the external function that it calls.

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    count_nums [label="_Z10count_numsSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];
    llvm_umax [label="llvm.umax.i64"];

    // Edges
    count_nums -> llvm_umax;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**:
  - `count_nums`: This represents the defined function `_Z10count_numsSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`.
  - `llvm_umax`: This represents the external function `@llvm.umax.i64` that is called within `count_nums`.

- **Edges**:
  - There is a directed edge from `count_nums` to `llvm_umax`, indicating that `count_nums` calls `llvm.umax.i64`.

You can use this dot representation to visualize the call graph using tools like Graphviz.
