Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can analyze the call graph and represent it in the DOT format. The IR code defines a function `@_Z7iscuberi` which calls another function `@llvm.abs.i32`. Here's how the call graph can be represented:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    iscuberi [label="iscuberi(i32)"];
    llvm_abs [label="llvm.abs.i32(i32, i1)"];

    // Edges
    iscuberi -> llvm_abs;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each function in the IR code is represented as a node. In this case, we have:
  - `iscuberi(i32)` representing the defined function.
  - `llvm.abs.i32(i32, i1)` representing the declared function that `iscuberi` calls.
  
- **Edges**: The arrow (`->`) indicates a call from `iscuberi` to `llvm.abs.i32`.

This DOT format can be used with Graphviz tools to visualize the call graph.
