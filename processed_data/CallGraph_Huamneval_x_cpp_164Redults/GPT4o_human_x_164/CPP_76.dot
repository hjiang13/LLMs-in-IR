Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can identify the function and its control flow. In this case, we have a single function `is_simple_power`. The function does not call any other functions, so the call graph will consist of just this function as a node.

Here is the dot format representation of the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    node [shape=rectangle];
    is_simple_power;
}
```

In this representation:
- We have a single node `is_simple_power` that represents the function defined in the IR code.
- There are no edges since there are no calls to other functions within the provided code. 

If there were additional functions or calls, we would create edges between the nodes accordingly.
