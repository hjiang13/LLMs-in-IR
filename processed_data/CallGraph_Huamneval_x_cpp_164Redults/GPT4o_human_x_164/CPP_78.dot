Based on the provided IR code input, we can extract the function definitions and the calls made within those functions to construct a call graph. The relevant function in this case is `_Z7hex_keyNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`, which makes calls to several LLVM intrinsic functions.

Here's the call graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    hex_key [label="_Z7hex_keyNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE"];
    llvm_lifetime_start [label="llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8"];
    llvm_lifetime_end [label="llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8"];
    llvm_memcpy [label="llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64"];
    __gxx_personality_v0 [label="__gxx_personality_v0"];

    // Edges
    hex_key -> llvm_lifetime_start;
    hex_key -> llvm_memcpy;
    hex_key -> llvm_lifetime_end;
    hex_key -> __gxx_personality_v0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each node represents a function defined or declared in the provided IR code. The main function `_Z7hex_keyNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE` is the entry point of the program, while the other nodes represent the functions that it calls.
- **Edges**: Directed edges indicate the calls made by the `hex_key` function to the other functions.

This representation captures the relationships between the function calls in a simple and clear manner suitable for visualizing the call graph.
