Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, the following is the call graph in DOT format. The nodes represent the functions, and edges indicate calls between them.

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Function Nodes
    node [shape=rectangle];
    make_a_pile [label="_Z11make_a_pilei"];
    __gxx_personality_v0 [label="__gxx_personality_v0"];
    _Znwm [label="_Znwm"];
    _ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc [label="_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc"];
    llvm_memmove [label="llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64"];
    _ZdlPv [label="_ZdlPv"];
    llvm_memset [label="llvm.memset.p0i8.i64"];

    // Edges
    make_a_pile -> _Znwm;
    make_a_pile -> _ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc;
    make_a_pile -> llvm_memmove;
    make_a_pile -> _ZdlPv;
    make_a_pile -> llvm_memset;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each function is represented as a node in the graph.
- The directed edges represent function calls. For instance, `make_a_pile` calls `_Znwm`, `_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc`, `llvm_memmove`, `_ZdlPv`, and `llvm_memset`.
- The labels of the nodes correspond to the mangled names of the functions as found in the input IR code.
