Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can derive the call graph that maps the functions and their calls. Hereâ€™s how the call graph can be represented in the DOT format, which is commonly used for graph visualization:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box]; // Optional styling for node shape
    search [label="_Z6searchSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];
    vectorDestructor [label="_ZNSt6vectorIS_IiSaIiEESaIS1_EED2Ev"];
    reallocInsert [label="_ZNSt6vectorIS_IiSaIiEESaIS1_EE17_M_realloc_insertIJS1_EEEvN9__gnu_cxx17__normal_iteratorIPS1_S3_EEDpOT_"];
    delete [label="_ZdlPv"];
    throwLengthError [label="_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc"];
    allocate [label="_Znwm"];
    llvmUmax [label="llvm.umax.i64"];
    lifetimeStart [label="llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8"];
    lifetimeEnd [label="llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8"];
    memset [label="llvm.memset.p0i8.i64"];

    // Edges
    search -> lifetimeStart;
    search -> delete;
    search -> reallocInsert;
    search -> vectorDestructor;
    search -> llvmUmax;
    search -> memset;

    vectorDestructor -> delete;
    vectorDestructor -> lifetimeEnd;

    reallocInsert -> allocate;
    reallocInsert -> throwLengthError;

    allocate -> delete;

    // Add more edges according to the functions' calls as needed
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each function in the IR is represented as a node, with its name (or mangled name) as the label.
- **Edges**: The directed edges indicate function calls. For example, the `search` function calls `lifetime.start`, `delete`, `reallocInsert`, and others, which are represented as directed edges from `search` to each of these functions.

This format can be used with graph visualization tools like Graphviz to create a visual representation of the call graph. You can expand and refine the edges based on further analysis of the IR for all function calls.
