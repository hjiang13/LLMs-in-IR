Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can identify the functions and their calls to construct a call graph. The IR outlines one function, `@_Z10below_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`, which makes a call to `@llvm.umax.i64`. 

Here is the call graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    "_Z10below_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE" [label="_Z10below_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];
    "llvm.umax.i64" [label="llvm.umax.i64"];

    // Edges
    "_Z10below_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE" -> "llvm.umax.i64";
}
```

### Explanation:
- The node `_Z10below_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` represents the function defined in the IR.
- The node `llvm.umax.i64` represents the external function declared in the IR which is called within the above function.
- The edge indicates that `_Z10below_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` calls `llvm.umax.i64`. 

You can visualize this graph using a DOT viewer or graph visualization tool to see the relationships more clearly.
