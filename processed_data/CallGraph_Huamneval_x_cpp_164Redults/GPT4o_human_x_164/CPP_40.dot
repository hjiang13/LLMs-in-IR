Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can extract the function definitions and the calls within them to create a call graph in the DOT format. Below is the call graph representation with nodes and edges:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    _Z19triples_sum_to_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE;
    llvm.umax.i64;

    // Edges
    _Z19triples_sum_to_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE -> llvm.umax.i64;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each function is represented as a node. In this case, there are two nodes: 
  - `_Z19triples_sum_to_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` is the function defined in the IR.
  - `llvm.umax.i64` is the external function that is called within `_Z19triples_sum_to_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`.

- **Edges**: The directed edge from `_Z19triples_sum_to_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` to `llvm.umax.i64` indicates that the first function calls the second function.

This representation can be rendered using graph visualization tools that support the DOT format.
