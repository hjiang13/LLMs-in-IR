Based on the provided IR code, the call graph can be constructed by analyzing the function definitions and the function calls within them. Here is the corresponding DOT format representation of the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Function nodes
    node [shape=box];
    any_intfff [label="_Z7any_intfff"];

    // External function nodes
    llvm_round_f32 [label="llvm.round.f32"];

    // Edges representing function calls
    any_intfff -> llvm_round_f32;
    any_intfff -> llvm_round_f32;
    any_intfff -> llvm_round_f32;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each function is represented as a node. 
  - `_Z7any_intfff` is the name of the defined function.
  - `llvm.round.f32` is the external function that is called three times within `any_intfff`.

- **Edges**: Directed edges represent calls from one function to another. 
  - `any_intfff` calls `llvm.round.f32` three times, hence three edges from `any_intfff` to `llvm.round.f32`.

This representation provides a clear view of the call relationships between the functions in the provided IR code.
