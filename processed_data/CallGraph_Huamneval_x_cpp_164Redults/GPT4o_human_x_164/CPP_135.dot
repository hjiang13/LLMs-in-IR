To create a call graph from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we need to identify the functions and their calls. In the given code, there are two functions:

1. `_Z11can_arrangeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`: This is the main function defined in the IR code.
2. `@llvm.umax.i64`: This is a declared function that is called within the main function.

Now, let's create a DOT representation of the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    "can_arrange" [label="_Z11can_arrangeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];
    "llvm_umax" [label="@llvm.umax.i64"];

    // Edges
    "can_arrange" -> "llvm_umax";
}
```

### Explanation:
- The nodes represent the functions in the code.
- The edge from `can_arrange` to `llvm_umax` shows that `can_arrange` calls the `llvm.umax.i64` function.

You can use this DOT format to visualize the call graph using tools like Graphviz.
