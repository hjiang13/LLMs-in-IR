Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can extract the call graph. The graph will consist of nodes representing functions and edges representing calls between those functions.

In your IR code, we have the function `_Z3fibi` defined, which makes calls to the functions `@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8` and `@llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8`. 

Here's the output in the DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=ellipse];
    fibi [label="_Z3fibi(i32)"];
    llvm_lifetime_start [label="@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8(i64, i8*)"];
    llvm_lifetime_end [label="@llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8(i64, i8*)"];

    // Edges
    fibi -> llvm_lifetime_start;
    fibi -> llvm_lifetime_end;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each function is represented as a node in the graph. The label of the node corresponds to the function signature.
- **Edges**: Directed edges indicate calls from one function to another. In this case, `_Z3fibi` calls both `@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8` and `@llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8`. 

You can visualize this DOT representation using graph visualization tools like Graphviz.
