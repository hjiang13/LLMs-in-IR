Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can analyze the call graph and represent it in a dot format. In the given IR, there is only one function defined, which is `_Z12prime_lengthNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`. Since there are no other functions called or defined in the provided code snippet, the call graph will consist solely of that function.

Hereâ€™s how the call graph looks in the dot format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    _Z12prime_lengthNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE;

    // Edges
    // No calls to other functions in the provided IR
}
```

In this representation:
- We define a directed graph (`digraph`) called `CallGraph`.
- There is one node representing the function `_Z12prime_lengthNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`.
- There are no edges since there are no function calls made within the given function. 

If there were other functions or calls present, they would be similarly added as nodes and edges as appropriate.
