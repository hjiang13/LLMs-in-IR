Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, here is the corresponding call graph in DOT format. The nodes represent functions, and directed edges represent function calls.

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    _Z11rolling_maxSt6vectorIiSaIiEE [label="_Z11rolling_maxSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];
    __gxx_personality_v0 [label="__gxx_personality_v0"];
    _ZdlPv [label="_ZdlPv"];
    _ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc [label="_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc"];
    _Znwm [label="_Znwm"];
    llvm_memmove_p0i8_p0i8_i64 [label="llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64"];
    llvm_memset_p0i8_i64 [label="llvm.memset.p0i8.i64"];

    // Edges
    _Z11rolling_maxSt6vectorIiSaIiEE -> llvm_memset_p0i8_i64;
    _Z11rolling_maxSt6vectorIiSaIiEE -> _ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc;
    _Z11rolling_maxSt6vectorIiSaIiEE -> _Znwm;
    _Z11rolling_maxSt6vectorIiSaIiEE -> _ZdlPv;
    _Z11rolling_maxSt6vectorIiSaIiEE -> llvm_memmove_p0i8_p0i8_i64;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each node represents a function defined or declared in the IR.
- The edges represent the calls made from one function to another.
- The function `_Z11rolling_maxSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` is the main function of interest, and it makes various calls to other functions such as `llvm.memset`, `llvm.memmove`, and others which are standard library or intrinsic functions.
