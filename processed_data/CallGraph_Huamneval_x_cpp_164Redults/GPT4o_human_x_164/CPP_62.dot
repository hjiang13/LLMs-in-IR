Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, here is the call graph in DOT format, showing the function calls as nodes and the relationships (edges) between them.

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    _Z10derivativeSt6vectorIfSaIfEE [label="_Z10derivativeSt6vectorIfSaIfEE"];
    __gxx_personality_v0 [label="__gxx_personality_v0"];
    _ZdlPv [label="_ZdlPv"];
    _ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc [label="_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc"];
    _Znwm [label="_Znwm"];
    llvm_memset_p0i8_i64 [label="llvm.memset.p0i8.i64"];
    llvm_memmove_p0i8_p0i8_i64 [label="llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64"];

    // Edges
    _Z10derivativeSt6vectorIfSaIfEE -> llvm_memset_p0i8_i64;
    _Z10derivativeSt6vectorIfSaIfEE -> _ZdlPv;
    _Z10derivativeSt6vectorIfSaIfEE -> _ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc;
    _Z10derivativeSt6vectorIfSaIfEE -> _Znwm;
    _Z10derivativeSt6vectorIfSaIfEE -> llvm_memmove_p0i8_p0i8_i64;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each function is represented as a node. The label of the node is the function name.
- **Edges**: Each arrow (`->`) represents a call from one function to another. For example, `_Z10derivativeSt6vectorIfSaIfEE` calls `llvm_memset_p0i8_i64`, `_ZdlPv`, `_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc`, `_Znwm`, and `llvm_memmove_p0i8_p0i8_i64`.

This representation outlines the relationships between the functions based on the calls made within the `derivative` function.
