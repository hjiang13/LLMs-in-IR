Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we need to analyze the control flow and extract the function calls to create a call graph. 

In the provided IR code, we have only one function defined, which is `is_sorted`. There are no direct calls to other functions within the provided code, so the call graph will primarily reflect the structure of the `is_sorted` function.

Here is the output in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Node representing the function
    "is_sorted" [label="is_sorted"];

    // Edges representing control flow
    "is_sorted" -> "11";
    "is_sorted" -> "32";
    "11" -> "13";
    "13" -> "19";
    "19" -> "23";
    "19" -> "29";
    "23" -> "32";
    "29" -> "13";
    "29" -> "32";
    "32" -> "1";
}
```

### Explanation:
- The node "is_sorted" represents the function defined in the IR.
- The nodes "11", "13", "19", "23", "29", and "32" represent the various labels (or basic blocks) within the function, showing the flow of control between them.
- The edges represent the flow of execution from one block to another, indicating how the function progresses through its logic. 
- Since there are no external function calls in the provided code, the graph only depicts the control flow within the `is_sorted` function. 

If there were other functions or calls present in the IR, we would include those accordingly in the graph.
