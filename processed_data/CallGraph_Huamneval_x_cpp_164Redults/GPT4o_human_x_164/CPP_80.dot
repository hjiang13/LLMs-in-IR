Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can identify the function defined in the module and construct a call graph. In this case, there is only one function, `_Z8is_happyNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`, which does not call any other functions. Therefore, the call graph will consist of a single node representing that function.

Here's the call graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Node representing the function
    node [shape=box];
    is_happy [label="_Z8is_happyNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE"];

    // Edges (function calls)
    // No edges since there are no calls to other functions
}
```

In this case, since the function does not call any other functions, there are no edges in the call graph. If there were additional functions that were called within `_Z8is_happy...`, they would be represented as edges in this graph.
