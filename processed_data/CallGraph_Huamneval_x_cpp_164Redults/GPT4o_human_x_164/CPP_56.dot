Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can analyze the call graph. In this case, there is only one function defined in the IR code, which is `correct_bracketing`. Since there are no calls to other functions within this function, the call graph will be simple, consisting of a single node for the function.

Here is the representation of the call graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    node [shape=box];

    // Function nodes
    CorrectBracketing [label="_Z18correct_bracketingNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE"];

    // Edges (function calls)
    // Since there are no other function calls, there are no edges.
}
```

### Explanation:
- The graph includes a single node named `CorrectBracketing`, which corresponds to the function `correct_bracketing`.
- There are no additional nodes or edges because the function does not call any other functions.
