Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can analyze the function definitions and their calls to create a call graph. In the provided IR code, we only have one function defined: `_Z3addii`. Since there are no calls to other functions or additional function definitions, the call graph will be quite simple.

Here is the dot file format for the call graph based on the provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    "_Z3addii" [label="_Z3addii"];

    // Edges
    // No edges since there are no function calls
}
```

In this case, there are no edges because the function `_Z3addii` does not call any other functions. If there were other functions and calls, we could add corresponding edges to the graph.
