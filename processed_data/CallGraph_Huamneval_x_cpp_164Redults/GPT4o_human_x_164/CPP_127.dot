To create a call graph from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we need to analyze the function definitions and calls within the code. In this case, there is one function defined, which is `@_Z12intersectionB5cxx11St6vectorIiSaIiEES1_`, and it makes a call to `@llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64`.

Here is the representation of the call graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    _Z12intersectionB5cxx11St6vectorIiSaIiEES1_ [label="_Z12intersectionB5cxx11St6vectorIiSaIiEES1_"];
    llvm_memcpy [label="llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64"];

    // Edges
    _Z12intersectionB5cxx11St6vectorIiSaIiEES1_ -> llvm_memcpy;
}
```

### Explanation:
- There is one function node representing the defined function `@_Z12intersectionB5cxx11St6vectorIiSaIiEES1_`.
- There is another node for the `@llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64` function, which is called within the defined function.
- The arrow (`->`) indicates that the first function calls the second function, forming a directed edge in the call graph.
