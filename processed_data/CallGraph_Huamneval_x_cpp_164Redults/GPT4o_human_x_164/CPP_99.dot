Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can identify the functions and their calls to create a call graph. The relevant functions in this IR code are:

1. `_Z15closest_integerNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE` (which we can refer to as `closest_integer`)
2. `@llvm.round.f64`
3. `@strtod`

Here's the call graph in DOT format, which includes the nodes and edges representing the function calls:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes representing the functions
    node [shape=box];
    closest_integer [label="closest_integer"];
    llvm_round_f64 [label="llvm.round.f64"];
    strtod [label="strtod"];

    // Edges representing the function calls
    closest_integer -> llvm_round_f64;
    closest_integer -> strtod;
}
```

This DOT representation describes a directed graph where `closest_integer` calls both `llvm.round.f64` and `strtod`. You can visualize this graph using any DOT graph visualization tool.
