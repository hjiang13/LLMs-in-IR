Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can identify the function and the flow of control through basic blocks. The call graph will consist of nodes representing the functions and edges representing the calls between them. In the provided code, there is only one function defined, which is `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter`. 

Since there are no function calls to other functions presented in the IR code, the call graph will be simple, containing just the node for the defined function.

Here is the call graph in the DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Function nodes
    node [shape=box];
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter;

    // Edges (function calls)
    // No function calls to other functions in the provided IR code
}
```

In this representation:
- `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` is the only node in the graph, representing the function defined in the IR code.
- There are no edges since there are no calls to other functions. 

If the IR code contained more functions or function calls, additional nodes and edges would be added to the call graph accordingly.
