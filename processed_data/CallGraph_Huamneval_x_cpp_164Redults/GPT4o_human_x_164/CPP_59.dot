Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can construct a call graph in the DOT format. The IR code contains a single function definition for `largest_prime_factori`. This function contains several basic blocks, which we can identify and represent as nodes in the call graph.

The basic blocks can be identified as follows:
- `entry`
- `3`
- `10`
- `12`
- `19`
- `end`

Here is the corresponding DOT representation:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes representing the basic blocks
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="entry"];
    block3 [label="Block 3"];
    block10 [label="Block 10"];
    block12 [label="Block 12"];
    block19 [label="Block 19"];
    end [label="end"];

    // Edges representing the control flow between blocks
    entry -> block3;
    block3 -> block10;
    block3 -> block12;
    block10 -> end;
    block12 -> block12; // Loop back
    block12 -> block19;
    block19 -> block10;
    block19 -> end; // Exit from block 19
}
```

In this graph:
- Each block is represented as a node.
- The edges represent the flow of control between these blocks, indicating where the program can branch or loop. 

Note: The names of the nodes (e.g., `Block 3`, `Block 10`, etc.) correspond to the basic block labels in the IR code. The `entry` node represents the starting point of the function.
