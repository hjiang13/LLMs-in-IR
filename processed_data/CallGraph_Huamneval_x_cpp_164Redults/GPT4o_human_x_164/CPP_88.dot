Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can extract the function calls and create a call graph in DOT format. The call graph will consist of nodes representing functions and directed edges representing calls from one function to another.

Here is the call graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes representing functions
    node [shape=box];
    
    // Functions
    sort_array;
    __introsort_loop;
    __final_insertion_sort;
    __make_heap;
    llvm_memset;
    llvm_ctlz;
    llvm_memmove;
    __gxx_personality_v0;
    __throw_length_error;
    operator_new;
    operator_delete;

    // Edges representing function calls
    sort_array -> __introsort_loop;
    sort_array -> __final_insertion_sort;
    sort_array -> llvm_memset;
    sort_array -> llvm_ctlz;

    __introsort_loop -> __make_heap;
    __introsort_loop -> __final_insertion_sort;

    __final_insertion_sort -> __introsort_loop;

    // Declarations for external calls
    llvm_memset -> llvm_memset;
    llvm_ctlz -> llvm_ctlz;
    llvm_memmove -> llvm_memmove;
    operator_new -> operator_new;
    operator_delete -> operator_delete;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each function is represented as a node in the graph, with the function names derived from the mangled names in the IR code.
- Directed edges represent calls between functions. For example, `sort_array` calls `__introsort_loop` and `__final_insertion_sort`.
- The formatting adheres to the DOT graph description language, which can be visualized with graphing tools like Graphviz.

Feel free to modify or extend this graph based on further requirements or specific visualization needs!
