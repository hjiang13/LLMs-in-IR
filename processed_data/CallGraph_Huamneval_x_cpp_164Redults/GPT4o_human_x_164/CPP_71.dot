To generate a call graph in DOT format from the given Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can identify the functions and their relationships. In your provided IR code, there are two functions: `@_Z13triangle_areafff` and `@pow`. The `@_Z13triangle_areafff` function makes a call to the `@pow` function.

Hereâ€™s the call graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    TriangleArea [label="triangle_area(float, float, float)"]
    Pow [label="pow(double, double)"]

    // Edges
    TriangleArea -> Pow
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each function is represented as a node in the graph. The label of each node corresponds to the function name and its parameters.
- **Edges**: There is a directed edge from `TriangleArea` to `Pow`, indicating that the `triangle_area` function calls the `pow` function. 

This representation provides a clear view of the function call relationships in the program.
