Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, I've constructed a call graph in the DOT format. The graph consists of the function definitions and the control flow between them. The only function defined in the provided IR is `_Z10same_charsNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEES4_`, and there is a call to `@__gxx_personality_v0`, which is a standard function called during exception handling in C++.

Here is the DOT representation of the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Define the nodes
    node [shape=box];
    func_same_chars [label="_Z10same_charsNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEES4_"];
    func_gxx_personality [label="__gxx_personality_v0"];

    // Define the edges
    func_same_chars -> func_gxx_personality;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: The nodes represent functions. In this case, `func_same_chars` corresponds to the function `_Z10same_charsNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEES4_`, and `func_gxx_personality` corresponds to `@__gxx_personality_v0`.
- **Edges**: The directed edge from `func_same_chars` to `func_gxx_personality` indicates that the `same_chars` function calls `__gxx_personality_v0`.

You can use this DOT format to visualize the call graph using tools like Graphviz.
