Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can extract the function definitions and their relationships to create a call graph in DOT format. The IR code contains a single function `@_Z17special_factoriali`. Since there are no other function calls or definitions present in the provided IR, we will represent this function as a single node in the graph.

Here is the Call Graph represented in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    Function1 [label="special_factoriali"];

    // Edges
    // There are no calls to other functions in this IR
}
```

In this representation:
- `Function1` corresponds to the function `@_Z17special_factoriali`.
- Since there are no function calls to other functions, there are no edges to represent. 

If there were additional functions and calls within the IR, we would add more nodes and edges accordingly.
