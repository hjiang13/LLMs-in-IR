To generate a call graph from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we need to identify the functions and their call relationships. In the provided IR code, there is only one function defined, `fizz_buzzi`. Since there are no other functions called within this function or defined elsewhere in the code, the call graph will be relatively simple.

Hereâ€™s the output in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Function Node
    fizz_buzzi [label="_Z9fizz_buzzi"];
    
    // Edges for function calls
    // No function calls are present in the provided IR code.
}
```

In this case, `fizz_buzzi` is the only node, and since no calls to other functions are made within it, there are no edges. If there were additional functions or calls, we would add those nodes and edges accordingly.
