To represent the call graph of the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we will extract the function names and the calls made between them. This will involve identifying functions that are defined as well as those that are called.

Hereâ€™s the call graph in the DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    node [shape=box];

    // Function Definitions
    filter_integers [label="filter_integers"];
    throw_exception [label="throw_exception"];
    clone_impl [label="clone_impl"];
    error_info_injector [label="error_info_injector"];
    copy_boost_exception [label="copy_boost_exception"];
    bad_any_cast_what [label="bad_any_cast::what"];
    __clang_call_terminate [label="__clang_call_terminate"];
    terminate [label="terminate"];
    throw_length_error [label="throw_length_error"];
    strcmp [label="strcmp"];
    __cxa_throw [label="__cxa_throw"];
    __cxa_allocate_exception [label="__cxa_allocate_exception"];
    __cxa_begin_catch [label="__cxa_begin_catch"];
    __cxa_free_exception [label="__cxa_free_exception"];
    bad_cast_dtor [label="bad_cast::dtor"];
    boost_exception_dtor [label="boost::exception::dtor"];
    
    // Function Calls
    filter_integers -> throw_exception;
    filter_integers -> strcmp;
    filter_integers -> throw_length_error;
    throw_exception -> __cxa_begin_catch;
    throw_exception -> terminate;
    clone_impl -> copy_boost_exception;
    clone_impl -> error_info_injector;
    bad_any_cast_what -> throw_exception;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each function is represented as a node in the graph.
- An arrow (`->`) indicates a call from one function to another.
- The functions named are derived from the provided IR code. I assumed that the function names are unique identifiers.
- Only the function signatures were included for clarity, and the actual content of the functions was not listed as per your request.

You can visualize this graph using any DOT file viewer or library, such as Graphviz.
