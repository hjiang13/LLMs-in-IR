Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can analyze the function and its control flow to generate a call graph in the DOT format. In this case, we have only one function defined (`_Z9is_nestedNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`). Since there are no calls to other functions present within this code snippet, the call graph will reflect only this function without edges to other functions.

Here is the call graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    _Z9is_nestedNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE;

    // Edges
    // No other functions to call, so no edges
}
```

This representation indicates that the function `_Z9is_nestedNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE` is the only node in the call graph with no outgoing edges, as it does not call any other functions.
