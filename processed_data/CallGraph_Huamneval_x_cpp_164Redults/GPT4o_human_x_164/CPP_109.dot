Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can identify the functions and their calls to create a call graph. 

In this case, we have the following function:
- `_Z13move_one_ballSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`
- A declaration for `@llvm.vector.reduce.add.v4i32` which can also be treated as a function in the call graph.

Here's the DOT format for the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    _Z13move_one_ballSt6vectorIiSaIiEE [label="_Z13move_one_ballSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];
    llvm_vector_reduce_add_v4i32 [label="llvm.vector.reduce.add.v4i32"];

    // Edges
    _Z13move_one_ballSt6vectorIiSaIiEE -> llvm_vector_reduce_add_v4i32;
}
```

### Explanation:
- The graph contains two nodes representing the functions in the provided IR code.
- There is a directed edge from `_Z13move_one_ballSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` to `llvm.vector.reduce.add.v4i32`, indicating that the first function calls the second function. 

You can use this DOT representation to visualize the call graph using graph visualization tools such as Graphviz.
