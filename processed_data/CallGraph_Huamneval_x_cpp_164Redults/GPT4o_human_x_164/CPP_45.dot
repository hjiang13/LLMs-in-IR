Based on the provided IR code snippet, there is only one function defined: `_Z13triangle_areaff`. Since there are no calls to other functions within this code snippet, the call graph will only include this function as a single node.

Here is the corresponding DOT format representation of the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    node [shape=rectangle];

    // Nodes
    "_Z13triangle_areaff" [label="_Z13triangle_areaff"];

    // Edges
    // No edges since there are no calls to other functions
}
```

In this case, the call graph has only one node corresponding to the function defined in the IR code, and there are no edges since there are no calls to any other functions. If additional functions were defined or called, they would be added as nodes and edges accordingly.
