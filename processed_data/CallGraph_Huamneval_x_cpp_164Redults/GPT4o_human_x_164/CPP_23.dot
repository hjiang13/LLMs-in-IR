Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will analyze the function definitions and their potential calls to construct a call graph. In the given IR code, there is one function defined: `strlen`.

Hereâ€™s the corresponding call graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    strlen [label="_Z6strlenNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE"];

    // Edges
    // Since there are no calls to other functions in the provided IR code,
    // we only show the function defined.
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Node**: Represents the `strlen` function.
- **Edges**: There are no edges since the provided IR code does not contain any calls to other functions.
