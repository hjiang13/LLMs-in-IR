Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can extract the function calls made within the code to create a call graph. The IR code contains two function declarations and one function definition. Here's the call graph represented in dot format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    _Z21double_the_differenceSt6vectorIfSaIfEE [label="_Z21double_the_differenceSt6vectorIfSaIfEE"];
    llvm_round_f32 [label="llvm.round.f32"];
    llvm_umax_i64 [label="llvm.umax.i64"];

    // Edges
    _Z21double_the_differenceSt6vectorIfSaIfEE -> llvm_round_f32;
    _Z21double_the_differenceSt6vectorIfSaIfEE -> llvm_umax_i64;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Nodes**: Each function is represented as a node. The function `_Z21double_the_differenceSt6vectorIfSaIfEE` is the only function defined in the IR, and it calls two other functions: `llvm.round.f32` and `llvm.umax.i64`.
2. **Edges**: Directed edges represent the calls from one function to another, indicating that the first function calls the second function.

You can visualize this graph using a tool that supports the DOT format, such as Graphviz.
