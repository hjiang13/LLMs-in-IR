Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can analyze the function calls and construct a call graph. The call graph will show the relationships between functions, including calls to external functions.

Here is the call graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    fibfibi [label="_Z6fibfibi"];
    llvm_lifetime_start [label="llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8"];
    llvm_lifetime_end [label="llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8"];

    // Edges
    fibfibi -> llvm_lifetime_start;
    fibfibi -> llvm_lifetime_end;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each node corresponds to a function in the IR code. In this case, we have:
  - `fibfibi`: The main function defined in the IR.
  - `llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8`: An external function called to start lifetime tracking.
  - `llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8`: An external function called to end lifetime tracking.

- **Edges**: The directed edges represent the calls made by the `fibfibi` function to the other functions. Thus, we see `fibfibi` calling both `llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8` and `llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8`.

You can use this DOT representation with graph visualization tools to visualize the call graph.
