Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can analyze the function calls and construct a call graph in the DOT format. Since the provided IR code only contains one function, `@_Z10choose_numii`, and does not show any calls to other functions, the call graph will reflect that single function.

Here's how the call graph would look in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Node for the function
    node [shape=box];
    choose_num [label="@_Z10choose_numii"];

    // No edges since there are no function calls
}
```

In this call graph:
- There is one node representing the function `@_Z10choose_numii`.
- There are no edges since the function does not call any other functions. 

If you have additional IR code with more functions and calls, please provide it, and I can help generate a more complex call graph.
