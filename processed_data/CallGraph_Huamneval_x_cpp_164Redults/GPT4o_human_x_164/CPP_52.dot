Here's the call graph represented in DOT format based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code. This includes the relevant function and declaration nodes, along with the edges indicating calls between them.

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    below_threshold [label="_Z15below_thresholdSt6vectorIiSaIiEEi"];
    llvm_umax [label="llvm.umax.i64"];
    
    // Edges
    below_threshold -> llvm_umax;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: 
  - `below_threshold`: Represents the function `_Z15below_thresholdSt6vectorIiSaIiEEi`, which is defined in the IR code.
  - `llvm_umax`: Represents the external function `llvm.umax.i64`, which is declared but not defined within the provided code.

- **Edges**: 
  - There is a directed edge from `below_threshold` to `llvm_umax`, indicating that the function `below_threshold` calls `llvm.umax.i64`.

This graph representation provides a clear overview of the function calls present in the IR code.
