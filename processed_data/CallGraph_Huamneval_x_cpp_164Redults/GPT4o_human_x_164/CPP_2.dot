Based on the provided IR code, I will create a call graph in DOT format. The given IR code contains only one function, `truncate_number`, and there are no indications of function calls to other functions within the provided code. Therefore, the call graph will only reflect this single function.

Here is the call graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Function nodes
    node [shape=box];
    
    // Defining the nodes
    truncate_number [label="_Z15truncate_numberf(float)"];

    // No edges as there are no calls to other functions in the provided code
}
```

In this output:
- The node `truncate_number` represents the function `_Z15truncate_numberf`.
- There are no edges because the function does not call any other functions based on the provided IR code. 

If there were other functions or calls, we would represent those relationships with additional nodes and directed edges.
