To generate a call graph from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we need to identify the function calls and their relationships. In the given IR code, there is one defined function (`_Z17remove_duplicatesSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`) and several declared functions. The calls to other functions can be highlighted as edges in the graph.

Hereâ€™s the representation of the call graph in the DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    node [shape=box];

    // Function Definitions
    remove_duplicates [label="_Z17remove_duplicatesSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];

    // Function Declarations
    memmove [label="llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64"];
    memset [label="llvm.memset.p0i8.i64"];
    delete [label="_ZdlPv"];
    throw_length_error [label="_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc"];
    new [label="_Znwm"];

    // Edges (function calls)
    remove_duplicates -> memset;
    remove_duplicates -> memmove;
    remove_duplicates -> delete;
    remove_duplicates -> throw_length_error;
    remove_duplicates -> new;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Nodes**: Each unique function is represented as a node in the graph.
2. **Edges**: Directed edges indicate calls from one function to another. 
   - The function `remove_duplicates` calls `llvm.memset.p0i8.i64`, `llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64`, `_ZdlPv`, `_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc`, and `_Znwm`.

You can use this DOT format to visualize the call graph using graph visualization tools like Graphviz.
