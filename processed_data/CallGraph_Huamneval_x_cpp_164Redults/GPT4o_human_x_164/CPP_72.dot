Based on the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we can extract the function calls and construct a call graph in the DOT format. In this case, we have a single function `@_Z11will_it_flySt6vectorIiSaIiEEi` which calls the function `@llvm.umax.i64`. Here's how the call graph looks in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    "_Z11will_it_flySt6vectorIiSaIiEEi" [label="_Z11will_it_flySt6vectorIiSaIiEEi"];
    "llvm.umax.i64" [label="llvm.umax.i64"];

    // Edges
    "_Z11will_it_flySt6vectorIiSaIiEEi" -> "llvm.umax.i64";
}
```

### Explanation:
- The nodes represent the functions in the IR code.
- The edge indicates a call from the function `@_Z11will_it_flySt6vectorIiSaIiEEi` to `@llvm.umax.i64`.
- Each function name is represented as a node, and the directed edge shows the flow of the call. 

You can save this DOT format in a `.dot` file and visualize it using graph visualization tools such as Graphviz.
