Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, I will generate a call graph in the DOT format. The nodes will represent the functions and the edges will represent the calls made between them.

Here is the call graph represented in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    _Z25count_distinct_charactersNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE;
    @tolower;
    @_ZdlPv;
    @_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc;
    @_Znwm;
    @llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64;

    // Edges
    _Z25count_distinct_charactersNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE -> @tolower;
    _Z25count_distinct_charactersNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE -> @_ZdlPv;
    _Z25count_distinct_charactersNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE -> @_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc;
    _Z25count_distinct_charactersNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE -> @_Znwm;
    _Z25count_distinct_charactersNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE -> @llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each function in the IR code is represented as a node. The main function `_Z25count_distinct_charactersNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE` is the primary function, while other functions it calls like `@tolower`, `@_ZdlPv`, `@_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc`, `@_Znwm`, and `@llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64` are included as well.
- **Edges**: Directed edges represent function calls, showing which function calls which other function.

You can use this DOT representation to visualize the call graph using graph visualization tools like Graphviz.
