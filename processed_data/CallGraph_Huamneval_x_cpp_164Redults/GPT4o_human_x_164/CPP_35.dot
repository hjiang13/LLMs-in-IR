Certainly! Below is the Call Graph represented in the DOT format based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code.

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Function Nodes
    node [shape=rectangle];
    max_element [label="_Z11max_elementSt6vectorIfSaIfEE"];

    // External Function Nodes
    llvm_umax [label="llvm.umax.i64"];

    // Edges
    max_element -> llvm_umax;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each function in the IR is represented as a node.
- The `max_element` function calls the external `llvm.umax.i64` function.
- The edges represent the call relationship between functions. 

This representation can be used with tools that support DOT format to visualize the call graph.
