To create a call graph from the given IR code, we need to identify the functions and their relationships based on the calls made within the code. The output format is a dot file representation, which includes nodes for each function and edges to represent the calls between them.

Here's the call graph based on your provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    _Z5pluckSt6vectorIiSaIiEE;
    @llvm.memset.p0i8.i64;
    @llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8;
    @__gxx_personality_v0;
    @llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8;
    @_ZdlPv;
    @_Znwm;
    @llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64;
    @llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64;

    // Edges
    _Z5pluckSt6vectorIiSaIiEE -> @llvm.memset.p0i8.i64;
    _Z5pluckSt6vectorIiSaIiEE -> @llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8;
    _Z5pluckSt6vectorIiSaIiEE -> @llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8;
    _Z5pluckSt6vectorIiSaIiEE -> @_ZdlPv;
    _Z5pluckSt6vectorIiSaIiEE -> @_Znwm;
    _Z5pluckSt6vectorIiSaIiEE -> @llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64;
    _Z5pluckSt6vectorIiSaIiEE -> @llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each function in the IR code is represented as a node.
- The arrows (edges) indicate function calls, showing which function calls which.
- The function `_Z5pluckSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` is the main function defined in your IR code, and it makes calls to several other functions (like memory management and lifetime functions).
- The functions that are declared but not defined in the provided IR code (like `@__gxx_personality_v0`) are also included as nodes in the graph.

You can use this dot representation to visualize the call graph using tools that support the Graphviz dot format.
