Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can determine the structure of the call graph. In this case, the function `_Z4fib4i` (which appears to be a Fibonacci function based on the name) makes calls to two functions: `@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8` and `@llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8`. These are lifetime management functions typically used in LLVM IR.

Here's the dot file representation of the call graph based on the provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    _Z4fib4i [label="_Z4fib4i"];
    @llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8 [label="@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8"];
    @llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8 [label="@llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8"];

    // Edges
    _Z4fib4i -> @llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8;
    _Z4fib4i -> @llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each function in the IR code is represented as a node.
- The edges represent the calls made from one function to another.
- In this case, the `@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8` and `@llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8` are called by `_Z4fib4i`, which is the only user-defined function in the provided IR code.
