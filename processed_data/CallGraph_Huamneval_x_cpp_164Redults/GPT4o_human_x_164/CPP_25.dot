To represent the call graph based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we focus on the function calls made within the code. In this case, we identify the functions defined and declared in the code, and represent them as nodes in a directed graph where edges indicate calls from one function to another.

Here is the dot format representation of the call graph derived from the provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    rankdir=LR;

    // Function nodes
    node [shape=ellipse];
    _Z9factorizei [label="_Z9factorizei"];
    @llvm.memset.p0i8.i64 [label="llvm.memset.p0i8.i64"];
    @__gxx_personality_v0 [label="__gxx_personality_v0"];
    @_ZdlPv [label="_ZdlPv"];
    @_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc [label="_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc"];
    @_Znwm [label="_Znwm"];
    @llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64 [label="llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64"];

    // Edges representing function calls
    _Z9factorizei -> @llvm.memset.p0i8.i64;
    _Z9factorizei -> @_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc;
    _Z9factorizei -> @_Znwm;
    _Z9factorizei -> @_ZdlPv;
    _Z9factorizei -> @llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each function is represented as a node in the graph.
- The edges between nodes indicate which function calls another function.
- The function `_Z9factorizei` is the primary function in the IR code, and it makes calls to several other functions (`@llvm.memset.p0i8.i64`, `@__gxx_personality_v0`, `@_ZdlPv`, `@_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc`, and `@_Znwm`, `@llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64`).
- The format uses standard Graphviz dot syntax, where `digraph` indicates a directed graph, and `node` and `edge` definitions are used to specify the properties of the nodes and the connections. 

You can visualize this call graph using any Graphviz-compatible tool.
