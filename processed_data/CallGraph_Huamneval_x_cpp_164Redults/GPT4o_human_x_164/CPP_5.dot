Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, I will generate a call graph in the DOT format. The graph will include nodes representing the functions and edges representing the calls between those functions.

Hereâ€™s the DOT representation of the call graph derived from the IR code:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    rankdir=LR;

    node [shape=box];

    // Function nodes
    "_Z11intersperseSt6vectorIiSaIiEEi";
    "llvm.memset.p0i8.i64";
    "__gxx_personality_v0";
    "_ZdlPv";
    "_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc";
    "_Znwm";
    "llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64";

    // Edges (calls)
    "_Z11intersperseSt6vectorIiSaIiEEi" -> "llvm.memset.p0i8.i64";
    "_Z11intersperseSt6vectorIiSaIiEEi" -> "_Znwm";
    "_Z11intersperseSt6vectorIiSaIiEEi" -> "_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc";
    "_Z11intersperseSt6vectorIiSaIiEEi" -> "_ZdlPv";
    "_Z11intersperseSt6vectorIiSaIiEEi" -> "llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64";
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each function is represented as a node.
- The edges represent calls made from one function to another.
- The `rankdir=LR` indicates that the graph should be laid out from left to right.
- The `shape=box` makes the nodes rectangular. 

You can visualize this DOT format using Graphviz or similar tools to see the call relationships between the functions in the provided IR code.
