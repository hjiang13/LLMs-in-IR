Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can construct a call graph in the DOT format. The IR code defines a single function named `_Z6x_or_yiii`, which does not call any other functions. Thus, the call graph will only contain this one function as a node.

Hereâ€™s the resulting DOT representation of the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Node representing the function
    node [shape=box];
    _Z6x_or_yiii [label="_Z6x_or_yiii"];
    
    // No edges since there are no function calls
}
```

In this representation:
- `_Z6x_or_yiii` is the only function in the graph, and it is depicted as a node.
- There are no edges because this function does not call any other functions in the provided IR code. 

If there were additional functions and calls, you would represent them similarly by adding more nodes and edges accordingly.
