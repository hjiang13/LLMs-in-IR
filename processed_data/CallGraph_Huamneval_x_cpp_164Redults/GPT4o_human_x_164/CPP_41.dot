Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can analyze the function definitions and create a call graph in the DOT file format. In the given code, there is only one function defined: `car_race_collision`. Since there are no function calls to other functions, the call graph will only have one node without any edges.

Here's the DOT representation of the call graph:

```
digraph CallGraph {
    // Node representing the function
    node [shape=box];
    car_race_collision [label="car_race_collision"];

    // No edges since there are no function calls
}
```

In this representation:
- The node `car_race_collision` represents the function defined in the IR code.
- There are no edges because this function does not call any other functions. 

If there were additional functions and calls between them, we would add corresponding nodes and edges to represent those relationships.
