To represent the call graph based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will analyze the functions and their relationships. The provided code defines a single function called `_Z20is_equal_to_sum_eveni`. Given that there are no calls to other functions within it, the call graph will consist of only this function.

Here's the call graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Node representing the function
    _Z20is_equal_to_sum_eveni [label="_Z20is_equal_to_sum_eveni"];
}
```

Since there are no calls to other functions or additional nodes in the provided IR, the graph contains only one node. If there were more functions or calls, they would be added similarly as nodes and edges in the graph.
