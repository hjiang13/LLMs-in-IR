Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can extract the function and its control flow to create a call graph in the DOT format. The function defined in the IR is `is_multiply_prime`.

Here is the DOT representation of the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];

    is_multiply_prime [label="is_multiply_prime"];

    // Edges
    // Since there are no other function calls in the provided IR code,
    // we only have the function itself with no outgoing edges.
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Node**: The single function `is_multiply_prime` is represented as a node.
- **Edges**: There are no calls to other functions within this single function, so there are no edges.

If there were other functions or more complex interactions, we would represent them as additional nodes and edges in the graph. Let me know if you have more IR code or need further assistance!
