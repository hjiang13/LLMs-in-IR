To represent the call graph derived from the given Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can identify the functions declared and defined in the code and show the relationships between them. 

Here's the dot format for the call graph, which includes the main function and the functions that it calls, as well as any other functions that are invoked:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes representing functions
    node [shape=box];
    words_in_sentence;
    _ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE9_M_createERmm;
    _ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE14_M_replace_auxEmmmc;
    _ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE9_M_appendEPKcm;
    _ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE10_M_replaceEmmPKcm;
    _ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE8_M_eraseEmm;
    _ZdlPv;
    __cxa_begin_catch;
    __gxx_personality_v0;
    _ZSt9terminatev;
    
    // Edges representing function calls
    words_in_sentence -> _ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE9_M_createERmm;
    words_in_sentence -> _ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE14_M_replace_auxEmmmc;
    words_in_sentence -> _ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE9_M_appendEPKcm;
    words_in_sentence -> _ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE10_M_replaceEmmPKcm;
    words_in_sentence -> _ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE8_M_eraseEmm;
    words_in_sentence -> _ZdlPv;
    words_in_sentence -> __cxa_begin_catch;
    words_in_sentence -> __gxx_personality_v0;
    words_in_sentence -> _ZSt9terminatev;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each function is represented as a node in the graph.
- Directed edges represent the calls made from one function to another.
- The main function in this case is `words_in_sentence`, which calls several other functions.
- Functions from the C++ Standard Library and LLVM intrinsics are included based on their usage in the IR code.

You can visualize this graph using graph visualization tools that support the DOT format, such as Graphviz.
