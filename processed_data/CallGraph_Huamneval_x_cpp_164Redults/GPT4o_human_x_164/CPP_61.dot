Based on the given Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can construct a call graph in the DOT format. The graph will represent function calls, showing nodes for each function and edges for the calls between them.

Here's the call graph in DOT format, based on the provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    _Z18correct_bracketingNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE;

    // Edges
    // There are no explicit function calls in the provided IR code, 
    // hence no edges to represent.
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Node**: The only function defined in the provided IR is `_Z18correct_bracketingNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`. This is a mangled name for the function that implements bracketing correctness checks.
  
2. **Edges**: There are no other functions called within the provided IR code, meaning there are no edges to represent inter-function calls.

If there were other functions defined and called within the IR, they would be represented as additional nodes and edges in this graph. However, the provided IR only contains a single function definition without any calls to other functions.
