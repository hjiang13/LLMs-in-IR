To generate a call graph from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we need to extract the functions and their call relationships. The following is a representation of the call graph in DOT format, which includes nodes for each function and edges for calls between them, using the function names as titles for the nodes.

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    median [label="_Z6medianSt6vectorIfSaIfEE"];
    introsort_loop [label="_ZSt16__introsort_loopIN9__gnu_cxx17__normal_iteratorIPfSt6vectorIfSaIfEEEElNS0_5__ops15_Iter_less_iterEEvT_S9_T0_T1_"];
    final_insertion_sort [label="_ZSt22__final_insertion_sortIN9__gnu_cxx17__normal_iteratorIPfSt6vectorIfSaIfEEEENS0_5__ops15_Iter_less_iterEEvT_S9_T0_"];
    make_heap [label="_ZSt11__make_heapIN9__gnu_cxx17__normal_iteratorIPfSt6vectorIfSaIfEEEENS0_5__ops15_Iter_less_iterEEvT_S9_RT0_"];
    ctlz [label="llvm.ctlz.i64"];
    lifetime_start [label="llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8"];
    lifetime_end [label="llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8"];
    memmove [label="llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64"];

    // Edges (Calls)
    median -> introsort_loop;
    median -> final_insertion_sort;
    introsort_loop -> make_heap;
    introsort_loop -> final_insertion_sort;
    final_insertion_sort -> make_heap;
    final_insertion_sort -> introsort_loop;
    median -> ctlz;
    introsort_loop -> lifetime_start;
    introsort_loop -> lifetime_end;
    final_insertion_sort -> lifetime_start;
    final_insertion_sort -> lifetime_end;
    make_heap -> memmove;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each function is represented as a node with its mangled name as the label.
- The arrows (edges) indicate which function calls which other function.
- Functions like `llvm.ctlz.i64`, `llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8`, `llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8`, and `llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64` are system-level calls typically used in LLVM IR, reflecting operations that are not user-defined but are part of the lower-level operations handled by the compiler.

You can use this DOT representation to visualize the call graph using graph visualization tools like Graphviz.
