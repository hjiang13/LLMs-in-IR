Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can extract the function definitions and the calls made between them to create a call graph in DOT format. The code includes one defined function, `_Z11count_up_toi`, and several declared functions that it interacts with.

Hereâ€™s the call graph represented in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    node [shape=rectangle];

    // Nodes
    _Z11count_up_toi [label="_Z11count_up_toi"];
    llvm_memset [label="llvm.memset.p0i8.i64"];
    __gxx_personality_v0 [label="__gxx_personality_v0"];
    _ZdlPv [label="_ZdlPv"];
    _ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc [label="_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc"];
    _Znwm [label="_Znwm"];
    llvm_memmove [label="llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64"];

    // Edges
    _Z11count_up_toi -> llvm_memset;
    _Z11count_up_toi -> _Znwm;
    _Z11count_up_toi -> _ZdlPv;
    _Z11count_up_toi -> _ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc;
    _Z11count_up_toi -> __gxx_personality_v0;
    _Z11count_up_toi -> llvm_memmove;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each function is represented as a node. The label of each node is the mangled name of the function.
- **Edges**: Directed edges represent calls from one function to another. For example, `_Z11count_up_toi` calls `llvm_memset`, `_Znwm`, `_ZdlPv`, `_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc`, `__gxx_personality_v0`, and `llvm_memmove`.

This representation provides a clear overview of the function calls in the provided IR code.
