Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, the function defined is `@_Z23greatest_common_divisorii`, which represents the greatest common divisor of two integers. Since there are no other function calls or definitions in the provided IR code, the call graph will consist of a single node for the function and its entry/exit points.

Here is the DOT format for the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Node representing the function
    node [shape=box];
    func_gcd [label="_Z23greatest_common_divisorii"];

    // Edges representing the control flow
    func_gcd -> entry [label="entry"];
    entry -> block_3 [label="br"];
    block_3 -> block_11 [label="if eq 0"];
    block_3 -> block_3 [label="loop back"];
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Node**: Represents the function `@_Z23greatest_common_divisorii`.
- **Edges**: 
  - The entry point of the function.
  - Control flow from block 3 to block 11 (the return block) based on the condition.
  - A self-loop in block 3 to indicate the loop back to itself.
  
Note: In the actual implementation, you may want to refine the nodes and edges further based on additional functions or more complex control flow if they exist in a larger context. But with the provided IR only representing one function, the output is kept focused on that single function.
