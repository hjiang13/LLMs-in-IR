Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can analyze the function calls and construct a call graph in the DOT format. However, the given IR code only contains a single function, `_Z9monotonicSt6vectorIfSaIfEE`, and does not invoke any other functions. Therefore, the call graph will only include this function as a node without any edges (since there are no calls to other functions).

Here is the DOT representation for the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    _Z9monotonicSt6vectorIfSaIfEE;

    // Edges
    // Since there are no function calls, there are no edges.
}
```

In this graph:
- The node `_Z9monotonicSt6vectorIfSaIfEE` represents the only function in the provided IR code.
- There are no edges since the function does not call any other functions. 

If there were additional functions and calls in the IR code, those would be represented as additional nodes and edges in the dot format.
