Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, I will derive the call graph in DOT format. The nodes will represent functions, and the edges will represent calls between those functions.

Here's the call graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    _Z7compareSt6vectorIiSaIiEES1_ [label="_Z7compareSt6vectorIiSaIiEES1_"];
    __gxx_personality_v0 [label="__gxx_personality_v0"];
    _ZdlPv [label="_ZdlPv"];
    _ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc [label="_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc"];
    _Znwm [label="_Znwm"];
    llvm_memmove_p0i8_p0i8_i64 [label="llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64"];
    llvm_abs_i32 [label="llvm.abs.i32"];
    llvm_memset_p0i8_i64 [label="llvm.memset.p0i8.i64"];
    
    // Edges
    _Z7compareSt6vectorIiSaIiEES1_ -> llvm_memset_p0i8_i64;
    _Z7compareSt6vectorIiSaIiEES1_ -> llvm_abs_i32;
    _Z7compareSt6vectorIiSaIiEES1_ -> _Znwm;
    _Z7compareSt6vectorIiSaIiEES1_ -> llvm_memmove_p0i8_p0i8_i64;
    _Z7compareSt6vectorIiSaIiEES1_ -> _ZdlPv;
    _Z7compareSt6vectorIiSaIiEES1_ -> _ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each function is represented as a node. The function names are derived from the mangled names you provided in the IR code.
- **Edges**: The edges represent the relationships, specifically which functions are called within `_Z7compareSt6vectorIiSaIiEES1_`. The functions that are called are included based on their declarations and the calls made in the IR code.

You can visualize this graph using tools that accept DOT format, such as Graphviz.
