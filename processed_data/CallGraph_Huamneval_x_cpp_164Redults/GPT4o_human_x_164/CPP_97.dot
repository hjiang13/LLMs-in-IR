Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can extract the functions and their relationships to create a call graph. The IR code defines a single function `_Z8multiplyii`, which calls the `@llvm.abs.i32` function. 

Here's the corresponding call graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    multiply [label="_Z8multiplyii"];
    llvm_abs [label="@llvm.abs.i32"];

    // Edges
    multiply -> llvm_abs;
}
```

### Explanation:
- The function `_Z8multiplyii` is defined in the IR code and calls the `@llvm.abs.i32` function.
- The edges represent the call relationships, where `multiply` calls `llvm_abs`.
- The nodes are labeled with the function names.
