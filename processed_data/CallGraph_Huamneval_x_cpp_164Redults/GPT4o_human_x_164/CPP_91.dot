Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, I will extract the function definitions and generate a call graph in DOT format. In this case, it appears that there is only one function defined (`_Z8is_boredNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`), and it does not call any other functions within the provided code.

Here is the generated DOT format for the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    _Z8is_boredNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE [label="_Z8is_boredNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE"];

    // Edges
    // No function calls within the provided code
}
```

This representation indicates that there is a single function in the call graph, and no edges are shown since it does not call any other functions. If additional functions were present in the IR code and had calls to each other, those would be represented as edges in the graph.
