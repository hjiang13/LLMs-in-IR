Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, I will create a call graph in the DOT format. The IR code contains a single function named `_Z8is_primex`, and the control flow is defined by various basic blocks.

Hereâ€™s the DOT representation of the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    is_primex [label="_Z8is_primex"];

    // Edges
    // Since the function does not call any other functions, there's no outgoing edge.
    // However, we can still represent the flow between basic blocks.
    block1 [label="Entry"];
    block2 [label="Block 3"];
    block3 [label="Block 5"];
    block4 [label="Block 13"];
    block5 [label="Block 15"];

    // Function to basic blocks mapping
    is_primex -> block1;
    is_primex -> block2;
    is_primex -> block3;
    is_primex -> block4;
    is_primex -> block5;

    // Basic block control flow
    block1 -> block2;
    block2 -> block3;
    block3 -> block4;
    block3 -> block5;
    block4 -> block5;
}
```

### Explanation:
- The graph consists of a single function node `_Z8is_primex`.
- Each basic block is represented as a node in the graph.
- The arrows (edges) show the flow of control among the basic blocks, indicating how execution can jump from one block to another based on the conditions specified in the IR code. 
- Since there are no calls to other functions in this snippet, there are no edges leading to other function nodes.
