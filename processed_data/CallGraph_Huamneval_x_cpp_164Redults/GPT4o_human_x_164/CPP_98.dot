To generate a call graph from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we need to identify the functions defined in the code and the functions they call. 

In the provided IR code, we have the following relevant function:

- **Function Defined:** 
  - `_Z11count_upperNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`

- **Functions Called:**
  - `@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8`
  - `@llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8`
  - `@llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64`
  - `@__gxx_personality_v0`

Here's the representation in the DOT format for the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    count_upper [label="_Z11count_upperNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE"];
    llvm_lifetime_start [label="llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8"];
    llvm_lifetime_end [label="llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8"];
    llvm_memcpy [label="llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64"];
    gxx_personality [label="__gxx_personality_v0"];

    // Edges
    count_upper -> llvm_lifetime_start;
    count_upper -> llvm_lifetime_end;
    count_upper -> llvm_memcpy;
    count_upper -> gxx_personality;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Nodes represent the functions:
  - The function `_Z11count_upperNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE` is the main function defined in the code.
  - The other nodes represent the library functions that are called within the main function.
  
- Edges indicate the calls made from the `count_upper` function to the other functions.
