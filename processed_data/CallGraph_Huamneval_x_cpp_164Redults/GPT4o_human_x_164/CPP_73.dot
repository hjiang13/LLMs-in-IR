Based on the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we will create a call graph in the DOT format. The graph will consist of nodes representing the function defined and any calls to that function. However, in the provided IR code, there is only one function (`_Z15smallest_changeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`) and no calls to other functions are present.

Here's the call graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Node for the function
    node [shape=box];
    smallest_change [label="_Z15smallest_changeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];
}
```

In this case, since there are no calls to other functions, the graph only contains a single node representing the function. If there were additional functions or calls within the IR code, they would be represented as additional nodes and edges in the graph.
