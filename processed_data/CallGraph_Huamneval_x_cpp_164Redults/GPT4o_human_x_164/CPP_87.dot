Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, I will generate a call graph in the DOT format. The nodes will represent functions, and directed edges will indicate function calls. Here's how the call graph looks:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    
    get_row [label="_Z7get_rowSt6vectorIS_IiSaIiEESaIS1_EEi"];
    vector_destructor [label="_ZNSt6vectorIS_IiSaIiEESaIS1_EED2Ev"];
    memset [label="llvm.memset.p0i8.i64"];
    gxx_personality [label="__gxx_personality_v0"];
    throw_length_error [label="_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc"];
    allocate_memory [label="_Znwm"];
    deallocate_memory [label="_ZdlPv"];
    
    // Edges (function calls)
    get_row -> memset;
    get_row -> vector_destructor;
    get_row -> allocate_memory;
    get_row -> deallocate_memory;
    get_row -> throw_length_error;
    
    vector_destructor -> deallocate_memory;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each node corresponds to a function in the IR code.
- **Edges**: An edge from one node to another indicates that the first function calls the second function. For instance, `get_row` calls `memset`, `vector_destructor`, and `allocate_memory`, among others. 

You can visualize this DOT representation using graph visualization tools to see the structure of the call graph.
