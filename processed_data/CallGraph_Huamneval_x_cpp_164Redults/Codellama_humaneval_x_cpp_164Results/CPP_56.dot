To represent the call graph of the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we will identify the function(s) defined in the IR and any calls made to them. In the provided code, we only see the definition of one function named `_Z18correct_bracketingNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`.

Here is the corresponding DOT format representation of the call graph based on the provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    _Z18correct_bracketingNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE;

    // Edges
    // No calls to other functions are present in the code
}
```

Since there are no function calls to other functions in the provided IR code, the graph contains only the single node representing the defined function with no edges.
