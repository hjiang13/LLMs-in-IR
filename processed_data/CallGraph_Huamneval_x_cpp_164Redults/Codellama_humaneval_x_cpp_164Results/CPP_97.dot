Based on the given Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can identify the functions and their relationships to create a call graph. In the provided IR, we have the following relevant functions:

1. `@_Z8multiplyii` - This is a defined function.
2. `@llvm.abs.i32` - This is a declared function that is called within the defined function.

The call graph can be represented in the DOT format as follows:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    "multiply" [label="_Z8multiplyii" shape=box];
    "llvm_abs" [label="llvm.abs.i32" shape=box];

    // Edges
    "multiply" -> "llvm_abs"; // multiply calls llvm.abs.i32
}
```

### Explanation:
- The node `"multiply"` represents the function `_Z8multiplyii` (which is a mangled name for a function, likely called `multiply`).
- The node `"llvm_abs"` represents the LLVM intrinsic function `@llvm.abs.i32`.
- The edge from `"multiply"` to `"llvm_abs"` indicates that the `multiply` function makes a call to the `llvm.abs.i32` function.

This representation captures the relationships between the functions in the provided IR code.
