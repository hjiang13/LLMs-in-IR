Based on the provided IR code, we can extract the function definitions and their calls to create a call graph in DOT format. In the given IR code, the primary function defined is `_Z11count_upperNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`. The other functions declared but not defined in the provided code are `@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8`, `@llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8`, and `@llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64`.

Here's how the call graph in DOT format would look:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=rectangle];
    count_upper [label="_Z11count_upperNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE"];
    llvm_lifetime_start [label="@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8"];
    llvm_lifetime_end [label="@llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8"];
    llvm_memcpy [label="@llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64"];
    gxx_personality [label="@__gxx_personality_v0"];

    // Edges
    count_upper -> llvm_lifetime_start;
    count_upper -> llvm_lifetime_end;
    count_upper -> llvm_memcpy;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Nodes**:
   - Each function is represented as a node in the graph.
   - The main function `_Z11count_upperNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE` is the entry point.
   - The functions `@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8`, `@llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8`, `@llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64`, and `@__gxx_personality_v0` are also included as they are called within the main function.

2. **Edges**:
   - Directed edges represent calls from one function to another.
   - The edges show that `count_upper` calls the three declared functions.

You can visualize this graph using any tool that supports the DOT format, such as Graphviz.
