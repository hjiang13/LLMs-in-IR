Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can derive a call graph that represents the functions and their relationships. In this IR code, there is one function defined: `_Z9is_sortedSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`. This function does not call any other functions. Therefore, the call graph will consist of just this single node with no outgoing edges.

Here is the DOT format representation of the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    node [shape=rectangle];

    // Function nodes
    is_sorted [label="_Z9is_sortedSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];

    // Edges (none in this case)
}
```

This graph indicates that the only function present is `is_sorted`, and it does not call any other functions, hence no edges. If there were additional functions or calls within the IR code, they would be represented as additional nodes and edges in the graph.
