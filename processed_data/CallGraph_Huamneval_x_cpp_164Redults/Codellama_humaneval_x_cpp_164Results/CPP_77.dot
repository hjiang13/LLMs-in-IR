Based on the given Intermediate Representation (IR) code input, we can analyze the function calls to create a call graph in the DOT format. In this case, we have one defined function `@_Z7iscuberi` and a declared function `@llvm.abs.i32`. We will represent these as nodes in the graph, with edges indicating the call relationship.

Here is the call graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    "Function: @_Z7iscuberi" [label="Function: @_Z7iscuberi"];
    "Function: @llvm.abs.i32" [label="Function: @llvm.abs.i32"];

    // Edges
    "Function: @_Z7iscuberi" -> "Function: @llvm.abs.i32";
}
```

### Explanation:
- `Function: @_Z7iscuberi` is the user-defined function in the IR code.
- `Function: @llvm.abs.i32` is the LLVM intrinsic function that is called within `@_Z7iscuberi`.
- The arrow (`->`) indicates that `@_Z7iscuberi` calls `@llvm.abs.i32`.
