To create a call graph from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will identify the functions and their relationships based on the function calls. The following functions are defined in the IR code:

1. **`_Z10do_algebraSt6vectorINSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEESaIS5_EES_IiSaIiEE`** - This is the main function of interest.
2. **`@__gxx_personality_v0`** - This is a personality function for exception handling.
3. **`@pow`** - This function computes the power of two doubles.
4. **`@_ZdlPv`** - This function deallocates memory.
5. **`@_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc`** - This function throws a length error.
6. **`@_Znwm`** - This function allocates memory.
7. **`@_ZNKSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE7compareEPKc`** - This is a comparison function for strings.

Based on the function calls made within the `do_algebra` function, we can derive the following edges for the call graph.

Here's the dot format representation of the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    do_algebra [label="_Z10do_algebraSt6vectorINSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEESaIS5_EES_IiSaIiEE"];
    personality [label="@__gxx_personality_v0"];
    pow [label="@pow"];
    dealloc [label=" @_ZdlPv"];
    throw_length_error [label="@_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc"];
    allocate [label="@_Znwm"];
    string_compare [label="@_ZNKSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE7compareEPKc"];

    // Edges
    do_algebra -> personality;
    do_algebra -> pow;
    do_algebra -> dealloc;
    do_algebra -> throw_length_error;
    do_algebra -> allocate;
    do_algebra -> string_compare;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each node corresponds to a function in the provided IR code.
- The arrows (`->`) indicate function calls from the `do_algebra` function to the other functions.
- The labels provide the mangled names of the functions as per C++ name mangling conventions. 

### Note:
- The calls to the functions are based on the provided IR and are assumed to be direct function calls.
- The IR might contain invocations of other functions not listed here, but the above captures the main call relationships based on what is explicitly shown.
- There may be additional functions or calls not visible in this snippet; further analysis of the entire IR may be required for a complete graph.
