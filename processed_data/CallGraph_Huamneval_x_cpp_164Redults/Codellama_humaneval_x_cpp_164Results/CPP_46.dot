Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can construct a call graph in DOT format. The call graph will include the function defined in the IR code and the functions it calls.

Here's the call graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];

    _Z4fib4i [label="_Z4fib4i"];
    llvm_lifetime_start [label="llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8"];
    llvm_lifetime_end [label="llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8"];

    // Edges
    _Z4fib4i -> llvm_lifetime_start;
    _Z4fib4i -> llvm_lifetime_end;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each function is represented as a node. In this case, we have:
  - `_Z4fib4i`: The main function defined in the IR.
  - `llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8`: A function called within `_Z4fib4i`.
  - `llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8`: Another function called within `_Z4fib4i`.

- **Edges**: The directed edges represent calls from one function to another.

This structure clearly represents the relationships between the functions in the given IR code.
