Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can analyze the function and generate a call graph in the DOT format. The IR code defines a single function, `_Z6strlenNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`. Since there are no calls to other functions within this function, the call graph will be relatively simple.

Here's the DOT representation of the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Define nodes
    node [shape=box];

    // Define function nodes
    _Z6strlenNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE;

    // Define edges (function calls)
    // Since there are no calls to other functions, there are no edges
}
```

In this call graph:
- The node represents the function `_Z6strlenNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`, which is the only function present in the provided IR code.
- There are no edges indicating calls to other functions since this function does not call any other function.

If there were additional functions defined in the IR code with function calls between them, those would be represented as additional nodes and edges in the graph.
