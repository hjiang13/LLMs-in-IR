To create a call graph from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we identify the function definitions and the calls made to those functions. In the provided IR code, we have one function defined (`_Z11will_it_flySt6vectorIiSaIiEEi`) and one external function declared (`@llvm.umax.i64`).

Hereâ€™s how the call graph can be represented in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Define nodes
    node [shape=box];
    WillItFly [label="_Z11will_it_flySt6vectorIiSaIiEEi"];
    Umax [label="@llvm.umax.i64"];

    // Define edges
    WillItFly -> Umax;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each function is represented as a node in the graph. The label of each node corresponds to the function name.
- **Edges**: An edge from `WillItFly` to `Umax` indicates that the function `WillItFly` makes a call to the external function `@llvm.umax.i64`.

You can further expand this graph if more functions or calls are present in your IR code. In this case, only one function makes a call to another, so the graph is quite simple.
