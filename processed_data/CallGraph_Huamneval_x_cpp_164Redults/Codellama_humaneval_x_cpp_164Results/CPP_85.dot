To construct the call graph from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can identify the function definitions and the calls made to those functions. Based on the given IR code, there are two functions: `_Z3addSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` and `@llvm.vector.reduce.add.v4i32`. 

The call graph in the DOT format will show these functions as nodes and the relationships (i.e., calls) between them as edges. Below is the corresponding DOT representation:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    "Function: _Z3addSt6vectorIiSaIiEE" [label="_Z3addSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];
    "Function: @llvm.vector.reduce.add.v4i32" [label="@llvm.vector.reduce.add.v4i32"];

    // Edges
    "Function: _Z3addSt6vectorIiSaIiEE" -> "Function: @llvm.vector.reduce.add.v4i32";
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each function is represented as a node in the graph. The labels indicate the function names.
- **Edges**: An edge from `_Z3addSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` to `@llvm.vector.reduce.add.v4i32` indicates that the former function calls the latter.

This representation provides a concise overview of the call relationships within the provided IR code.
