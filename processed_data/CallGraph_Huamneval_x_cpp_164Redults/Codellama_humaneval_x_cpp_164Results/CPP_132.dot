Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can analyze the function calls and control flow to create a call graph in the DOT format. Since the provided code only contains a single function, `_Z9is_nestedNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`, the call graph will reflect that single function without any additional calls to other functions.

Here is the DOT representation of the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Node representing the function
    node [shape=box];
    _Z9is_nestedNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE;

    // Since there are no other functions called within it,
    // there are no edges to other functions.
}
```

In this case, there are no outgoing edges because there are no calls to other functions within `_Z9is_nestedNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`. If there were additional functions or calls present in the IR, we would represent them with additional nodes and edges accordingly.
