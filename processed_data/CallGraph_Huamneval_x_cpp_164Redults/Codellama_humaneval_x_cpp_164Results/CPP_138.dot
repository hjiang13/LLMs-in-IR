To create a call graph from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we need to extract function calls. In the given IR code, there is only one function defined: `_Z20is_equal_to_sum_eveni`. Since there are no calls to other functions within this code, the call graph will be relatively simple. Below is the representation of the call graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    Node1 [label="_Z20is_equal_to_sum_eveni"];

    // Edges
    // No edges since there are no calls to other functions in the provided code
}
```

In this case, the graph only contains one node representing the single function, and there are no edges connecting to other functions since no function calls are present in the given IR code. If there were any function calls, they would be represented as edges connecting the nodes.
