Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can extract the function definitions and their calls to create a call graph. In this case, we only see one function, `_Z30check_if_last_char_is_a_letterNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`, with no calls to other functions.

Hereâ€™s the call graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter;

    // Edges
    // Since there are no calls to other functions, no edges are needed.
}
```

In this case, the only node in the call graph is the function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter`, and there are no edges as it does not call any other functions. If there were more functions and calls within the IR code, additional nodes and edges would be included to represent those relationships.
