Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, the call graph can be represented in the DOT format. The call graph will include the functions and their relationships (i.e., which functions call which). 

In the provided IR code, we have two functions: `@_Z13triangle_areafff` and `@pow`. The function `@_Z13triangle_areafff` makes a call to `@pow`. 

Here's the DOT representation of the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    "_Z13triangle_areafff" [label="_Z13triangle_areafff"];
    "pow" [label="pow"];

    // Edges
    "_Z13triangle_areafff" -> "pow";
}
```

In this graph:
- The node `_Z13triangle_areafff` represents the function that calculates the area of a triangle.
- The node `pow` represents the power function that is called within `_Z13triangle_areafff`.
- The directed edge from `_Z13triangle_areafff` to `pow` indicates that the triangle area function calls the power function. 

You can utilize this DOT format to visualize the call graph using graph visualization tools that support DOT files.
