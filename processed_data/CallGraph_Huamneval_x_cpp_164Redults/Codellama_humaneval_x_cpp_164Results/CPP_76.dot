To construct a call graph from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we need to analyze the function definitions and any potential function calls. In the given IR code, we only have a single function defined: `_Z15is_simple_powerii`, which appears to check if a number is a simple power of another number. There are no calls to other functions within this function.

Since there are no other functions called, the call graph will only consist of this single function. Hereâ€™s how the call graph can be represented in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Define nodes
    node [shape=rectangle];
    is_simple_power;

    // Define edges
    // No edges since there are no calls to other functions
}
```

In this representation:
- The node `is_simple_power` corresponds to the function `_Z15is_simple_powerii`.
- There are no edges since it does not call any other functions.

This is a very simple call graph based on the provided IR code. If there were additional functions and calls, we would include those as additional nodes and edges in the graph.
