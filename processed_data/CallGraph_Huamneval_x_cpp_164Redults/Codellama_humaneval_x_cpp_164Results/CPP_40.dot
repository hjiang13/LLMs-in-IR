Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can analyze the function calls and create a call graph in DOT format. The only function that makes a call in this code is `@_Z19triples_sum_to_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`, which calls `@llvm.umax.i64`.

Hereâ€™s how the call graph would look in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    "Function: @_Z19triples_sum_to_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE" [label="Function: @_Z19triples_sum_to_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];
    "Function: @llvm.umax.i64" [label="Function: @llvm.umax.i64"];

    // Edges
    "Function: @_Z19triples_sum_to_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE" -> "Function: @llvm.umax.i64";
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each node represents a function in the program. Here, we have two nodes: one for the main function `@_Z19triples_sum_to_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` and one for the external function `@llvm.umax.i64`.
- **Edges**: The directed edge from `@_Z19triples_sum_to_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` to `@llvm.umax.i64` indicates that the first function calls the second one.

This is a simple representation based on the function calls observed in the IR code provided.
