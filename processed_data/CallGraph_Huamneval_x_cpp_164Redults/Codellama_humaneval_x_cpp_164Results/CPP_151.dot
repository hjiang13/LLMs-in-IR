The call graph for the given IR code can be represented in the DOT format, which is a graph description language. Based on the provided IR code, we can identify the functions and their calls. The relevant functions in this case are:

1. `@_Z21double_the_differenceSt6vectorIfSaIfEE`
2. `@llvm.round.f32`
3. `@llvm.umax.i64`

Here is the DOT representation of the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Function Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    double_the_difference [label="_Z21double_the_differenceSt6vectorIfSaIfEE"];
    llvm_round_f32 [label="llvm.round.f32"];
    llvm_umax_i64 [label="llvm.umax.i64"];

    // Edges to represent function calls
    double_the_difference -> llvm_round_f32;
    double_the_difference -> llvm_umax_i64;
}
```

In this graph:
- `double_the_difference` is the primary function that calls `llvm.round.f32` and `llvm.umax.i64`.
- Each node represents a function, and the directed edges indicate the calls made from one function to another.
