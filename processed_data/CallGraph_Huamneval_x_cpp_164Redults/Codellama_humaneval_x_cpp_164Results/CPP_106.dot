To represent the call graph of the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in the DOT format, we will extract the function declarations and calls. Based on the provided IR code, the following functions are present:

1. `_Z1fi` (the main function)
2. `@llvm.memset.p0i8.i64`
3. `@__gxx_personality_v0`
4. `_ZdlPv`
5. `_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc`
6. `_Znwm`
7. `@llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64`

The call graph will show the relationships between the calling function and the called functions. Hereâ€™s how the call graph can be constructed in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Define nodes
    node [shape=box];
    _Z1fi [label="_Z1fi"];
    llvm_memset [label="@llvm.memset.p0i8.i64"];
    __gxx_personality [label="@__gxx_personality_v0"];
    _ZdlPv [label="_ZdlPv"];
    _ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc [label="_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc"];
    _Znwm [label="_Znwm"];
    llvm_memmove [label="@llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64"];
    
    // Define edges (function calls)
    _Z1fi -> llvm_memset;
    _Z1fi -> _ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc;
    _Z1fi -> _Znwm;
    _Z1fi -> _ZdlPv;
    _ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc -> __gxx_personality;
    _Znwm -> llvm_memset;
    _Znwm -> llvm_memmove;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each function is represented as a node in the graph.
- The arrows (`->`) represent function calls, showing which functions are called by `_Z1fi` (the main function) and other functions called within it.
- The labels in the nodes represent the names of the functions as they appear in the IR code.

You can visualize this graph using tools that support the DOT format, such as Graphviz.
