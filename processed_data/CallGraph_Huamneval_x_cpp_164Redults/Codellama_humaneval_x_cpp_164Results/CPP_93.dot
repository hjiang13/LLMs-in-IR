To generate a call graph from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we need to identify the functions and their relationships based on the function calls present in the code.

Based on the provided IR, here is the call graph in DOT format, which includes nodes for each function and edges representing the calls between them:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];

    // Functions
    encode [label="_Z6encodeNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE"];
    llvm_lifetime_start [label="llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8"];
    llvm_lifetime_end [label="llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8"];
    gxx_personality [label="__gxx_personality_v0"];
    free [label="_ZdlPv"];
    basic_string_create [label="_ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE9_M_createERmm"];
    basic_string_replace [label="_ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE14_M_replace_auxEmmmc"];
    memcpy [label="llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64"];
    noalias_scope_decl [label="llvm.experimental.noalias.scope.decl"];

    // Edges (function calls)
    encode -> llvm_lifetime_start;
    encode -> llvm_lifetime_end;
    encode -> gxx_personality;
    encode -> free;
    encode -> basic_string_create;
    encode -> basic_string_replace;
    encode -> memcpy;
    encode -> noalias_scope_decl;
}
```

### Explanation of the Graph:
- Each function is represented as a node in the graph.
- Directed edges (arrows) indicate a call from one function to another.
- The `label` attribute of each node shows the name of the function it represents.
- The `encode` function is the main function whose calls to other functions are represented by the edges.

You can visualize this call graph using any tool that supports the DOT format, such as Graphviz.
