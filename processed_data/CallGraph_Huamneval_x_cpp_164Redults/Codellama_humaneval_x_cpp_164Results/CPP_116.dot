To create the call graph in DOT format based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we need to identify the functions and their relationships (calls) within the code.

From the provided IR code, we can see the following functions:
1. `_Z10sort_arraySt6vectorIiSaIiEE` (the main function defined in the IR)
2. `@llvm.abs.i32`
3. `@llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64`
4. `@llvm.memset.p0i8.i64`
5. `@__gxx_personality_v0`
6. `_ZdlPv`
7. `_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc`
8. `_Znwm`

The main function `_Z10sort_arraySt6vectorIiSaIiEE` calls several functions, including `@llvm.abs.i32`, `@llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64`, `@llvm.memset.p0i8.i64`, `_ZdlPv`, and `_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc`.

Here's the DOT representation of the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=rectangle];
    sort_array [label="_Z10sort_arraySt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];
    llvm_abs [label="@llvm.abs.i32"];
    llvm_memmove [label="@llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64"];
    llvm_memset [label="@llvm.memset.p0i8.i64"];
    gxx_personality [label="@__gxx_personality_v0"];
    delete [label="_ZdlPv"];
    throw_length_error [label="_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc"];
    new [label="_Znwm"];

    // Edges
    sort_array -> llvm_abs;
    sort_array -> llvm_memmove;
    sort_array -> llvm_memset;
    sort_array -> delete;
    sort_array -> throw_length_error;
    sort_array -> new;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each function is represented as a node in the graph.
- Directed edges (arrows) indicate the calls made from the main function to the other functions.
- The `label` attributes are used to give a meaningful name to each node, matching the function signatures found in the IR code.
- The graph can be visualized using graph visualization tools that accept DOT format, such as Graphviz.
