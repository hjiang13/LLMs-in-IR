Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can generate a call graph in the DOT format. The code defines a single function `greatest_common_divisor`, and since there are no other function calls or definitions in the provided code, the call graph will be relatively simple.

Here's the DOT representation of the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=rectangle];
    GCD [label="greatest_common_divisor"];

    // Edges
    // There are no calls to other functions in the provided IR code.
}
```

In this representation:
- We have a single node for the function `greatest_common_divisor`.
- There are no edges because there are no function calls within the given IR code. 

If you have more functions or calls in different IR code segments, please provide them, and I can update the call graph accordingly.
