Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, here is the call graph represented in DOT format. The nodes represent the functions defined in the IR, and the directed edges represent the calls made between these functions.

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Function nodes
    node [shape=box];
    median [label="_Z6medianSt6vectorIfSaIfEE"];
    introsort_loop [label="_ZSt16__introsort_loopIN9__gnu_cxx17__normal_iteratorIPfSt6vectorIfSaIfEEEElNS0_5__ops15_Iter_less_iterEEvT_S9_T0_T1_"];
    final_insertion_sort [label="_ZSt22__final_insertion_sortIN9__gnu_cxx17__normal_iteratorIPfSt6vectorIfSaIfEEEENS0_5__ops15_Iter_less_iterEEvT_S9_T0_"];
    make_heap [label="_ZSt11__make_heapIN9__gnu_cxx17__normal_iteratorIPfSt6vectorIfSaIfEEEENS0_5__ops15_Iter_less_iterEEvT_S9_RT0_"];
    ctlz [label="llvm.ctlz.i64"];

    // Edges representing function calls
    median -> introsort_loop;
    median -> final_insertion_sort;
    introsort_loop -> make_heap;
    introsort_loop -> introsort_loop;  // Recursive call
    final_insertion_sort -> final_insertion_sort;  // Recursive call
    make_heap -> make_heap;  // Recursive call
    // You can add more edges based on any additional function calls found in the IR code.
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each function is represented as a node.
- The arrows (edges) indicate that one function calls another. For example, `median` calls both `introsort_loop` and `final_insertion_sort`.
- Recursive calls are indicated by an edge from a function to itself.
- The `ctlz` function is declared but not called directly in the provided IR, so it does not have any edges connecting to it.

You can render this DOT graph using Graphviz or any other tool that supports the DOT format to visualize the call graph.
