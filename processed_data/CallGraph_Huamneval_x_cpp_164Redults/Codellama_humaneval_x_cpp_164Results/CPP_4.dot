Based on the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we can construct a call graph in the DOT format. In this graph, the nodes represent functions, and the edges represent calls between those functions.

Here is the corresponding DOT representation of the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];

    // Function Definitions
    _Z23mean_absolute_deviationSt6vectorIfSaIfEE [label="_Z23mean_absolute_deviationSt6vectorIfSaIfEE"];
    llvm_fabs_f32 [label="llvm.fabs.f32"];
    llvm_umax_i64 [label="llvm.umax.i64"];

    // Edges (function calls)
    _Z23mean_absolute_deviationSt6vectorIfSaIfEE -> llvm_fabs_f32;
    _Z23mean_absolute_deviationSt6vectorIfSaIfEE -> llvm_umax_i64;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Nodes**: Each function is represented as a node. The main function in this code is `_Z23mean_absolute_deviationSt6vectorIfSaIfEE`, which is the definition of the mean absolute deviation function. The two declared functions, `llvm.fabs.f32` and `llvm.umax.i64`, are also included as nodes.

2. **Edges**: The edges indicate which functions call which. In this case, `_Z23mean_absolute_deviationSt6vectorIfSaIfEE` makes calls to both `llvm.fabs.f32` and `llvm.umax.i64`.

You can visualize this graph using any DOT-compatible graph visualization tool, such as Graphviz.
