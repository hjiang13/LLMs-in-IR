Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can identify the functions and the calls made within them to create a call graph. The call graph will represent the relationships between the functions, showing which functions call which other functions.

From the given IR code, we can see that there are two declared functions: `@llvm.ceil.f32` and `@llvm.umax.i64`. The primary function defined in the IR code is `_Z11sum_squaresSt6vectorIfSaIfEE`.

Here's the call graph represented in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Function nodes
    node [shape=box];
    sum_squares [label="_Z11sum_squaresSt6vectorIfSaIfEE"];
    llvm_ceil_f32 [label="@llvm.ceil.f32"];
    llvm_umax_i64 [label="@llvm.umax.i64"];

    // Edges representing function calls
    sum_squares -> llvm_ceil_f32;
    sum_squares -> llvm_umax_i64;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**:
  - `sum_squares`: This is the main function defined in the IR code.
  - `llvm_ceil_f32`: This function is declared and called within `sum_squares`.
  - `llvm_umax_i64`: This function is also declared and called within `sum_squares`.

- **Edges**: 
  - The arrows (`->`) indicate the calls from `sum_squares` to `llvm_ceil_f32` and `llvm_umax_i64`.

This representation provides a clear view of the call relationships within the program.
