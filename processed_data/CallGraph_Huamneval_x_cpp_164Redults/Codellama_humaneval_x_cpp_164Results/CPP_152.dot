Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can extract the function calls to construct a call graph. The resulting graph will represent the functions and their relationships.

Here's a simplified representation of the call graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    _Z7compareSt6vectorIiSaIiEES1_ [label="_Z7compareSt6vectorIiSaIiEES1_"];
    __gxx_personality_v0 [label="__gxx_personality_v0"];
    _ZdlPv [label="_ZdlPv"];
    _ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc [label="_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc"];
    _Znwm [label="_Znwm"];
    llvm_memmove_p0i8_p0i8_i64 [label="llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64"];
    llvm_abs_i32 [label="llvm.abs.i32"];
    llvm_memset_p0i8_i64 [label="llvm.memset.p0i8.i64"];

    // Edges
    _Z7compareSt6vectorIiSaIiEES1_ -> llvm_memset_p0i8_i64;
    _Z7compareSt6vectorIiSaIiEES1_ -> llvm_abs_i32;
    _Z7compareSt6vectorIiSaIiEES1_ -> _ZdlPv;
    _Z7compareSt6vectorIiSaIiEES1_ -> _ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc;
    _Z7compareSt6vectorIiSaIiEES1_ -> _Znwm;
    _Z7compareSt6vectorIiSaIiEES1_ -> llvm_memmove_p0i8_p0i8_i64;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each function defined in the IR code has been represented as a node in the graph.
- **Edges**: The edges represent the function calls. For instance, `_Z7compareSt6vectorIiSaIiEES1_` (the main function) calls several other functions such as `llvm.memset.p0i8.i64`, `llvm.abs.i32`, `_ZdlPv`, `_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc`, and `_Znwm`.

You can visualize this graph using Graphviz or any compatible tool that accepts DOT format.
