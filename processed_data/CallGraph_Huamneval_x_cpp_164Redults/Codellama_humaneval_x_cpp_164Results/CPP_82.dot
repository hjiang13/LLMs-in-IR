To represent the call graph based on the provided IR code, we will analyze the function definitions and their relationships. In this case, we only have one function, `_Z12prime_lengthNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`, which does not make any calls to other functions. Thus, the call graph will consist of just that single function with no edges.

Here's the call graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    "prime_length(std::__cxx11::basic_string)" [label="prime_length(std::__cxx11::basic_string)"];

    // Edges
    // No edges since there are no function calls
}
```

This graph indicates that there is a single function, `prime_length`, but it does not call any other functions, hence there are no edges in the graph.
