Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can identify the functions and external declarations to construct the call graph. The key functions in the IR code are:

1. `_Z12get_positiveSt6vectorIfSaIfEE` (the primary function defined in the module)
2. `@llvm.memset.p0i8.i64` (declared)
3. `@__gxx_personality_v0` (declared)
4. `_ZdlPv` (declared)
5. `_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc` (declared)
6. `_Znwm` (declared)
7. `@llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64` (declared)

Using this information, we can construct a simple call graph in the DOT format, where each function is represented as a node and the calls between them are represented as directed edges.

Hereâ€™s the DOT representation of the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    node [shape=rectangle];

    // Nodes
    get_positive [label="_Z12get_positiveSt6vectorIfSaIfEE"];
    llvm_memset [label="@llvm.memset.p0i8.i64"];
    gxx_personality [label="@__gxx_personality_v0"];
    dlPv [label="_ZdlPv"];
    throw_length_error [label="_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc"];
    Znwm [label="_Znwm"];
    llvm_memmove [label="@llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64"];

    // Edges
    get_positive -> llvm_memset;
    get_positive -> gxx_personality;
    get_positive -> dlPv;
    get_positive -> throw_length_error;
    get_positive -> Znwm;
    get_positive -> llvm_memmove;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each function is represented as a node in the graph.
- The arrows represent calls made from the `get_positive` function to the various declared functions.
- The node labels correspond to the function names as they appear in the IR code. 

You can visualize this DOT representation using a graph visualization tool that supports the DOT format (e.g., Graphviz).
