Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, I will construct a call graph in the DOT format. The graph will include nodes for the functions defined and any calls made between them. In this case, we have one function `_Z12intersectionB5cxx11St6vectorIiSaIiEES1_` and a declaration for `@__gxx_personality_v0` which is an external function. 

Hereâ€™s the DOT representation of the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Function Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    _Z12intersectionB5cxx11St6vectorIiSaIiEES1_ [label="_Z12intersectionB5cxx11St6vectorIiSaIiEES1_"];
    __gxx_personality_v0 [label="__gxx_personality_v0"];

    // Edges
    _Z12intersectionB5cxx11St6vectorIiSaIiEES1_ -> __gxx_personality_v0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: They represent the functions in the program. In this case, we have:
  - `_Z12intersectionB5cxx11St6vectorIiSaIiEES1_`: The defined function.
  - `__gxx_personality_v0`: An external function that is called within the defined function.

- **Edges**: They represent the calls between functions. The edge indicates that `_Z12intersectionB5cxx11St6vectorIiSaIiEES1_` calls `__gxx_personality_v0`.

This representation provides a clear and concise view of the call relationships in the analyzed IR code.
