Certainly! Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, I can generate a call graph in DOT format. The relevant functions and their calls are represented as nodes and edges.

Hereâ€™s the call graph based on the provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    prime_fibi [label="prime_fibi"];
    llvm_assume [label="llvm.assume"];

    // Edges
    prime_fibi -> llvm_assume;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: The nodes represent the functions in the IR code. In this case, we have `prime_fibi`, which is the main function defined in the IR, and `llvm.assume`, which is called within `prime_fibi`.
- **Edges**: The edges represent the calls from one function to another. Here, `prime_fibi` calls `llvm.assume`.

You can use this DOT format to visualize the call graph using tools that support the DOT language, such as Graphviz.
