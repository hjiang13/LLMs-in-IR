Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can construct a call graph in the DOT format. The function defined in the IR is `_Z17special_factoriali`, and it contains several basic blocks. In the call graph, we will represent the function as a node and the control flow between basic blocks as edges.

Hereâ€™s how the call graph can be represented in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Node representing the function
    node [shape=box];
    _Z17special_factoriali;

    // Basic blocks as nodes
    B1 [label="3"];
    B2 [label="10"];
    B3 [label="12"];
    B4 [label="18"];
    B5 [label="28"];
    B6 [label="30"];

    // Edges representing control flow
    _Z17special_factoriali -> B1;
    B1 -> B2; // Control flow from block 1 to block 2
    B1 -> B3; // Control flow from block 1 to block 3
    B2 -> B6; // Control flow from block 2 to block 6
    B3 -> B4; // Control flow from block 3 to block 4
    B4 -> B4; // Loop back in block 4
    B4 -> B5; // Control flow from block 4 to block 5
    B4 -> B6; // Control flow from block 4 to block 6
    B6 -> B3; // Loop back in block 6
    B6 -> B6; // Loop in block 6
}
```

In this representation:
- Each basic block is represented as a node with the label corresponding to its identifier (e.g., "3", "10", "12", "18", "28", "30").
- The edges indicate control flow between these basic blocks.
- The function `_Z17special_factoriali` is the entry point of the graph, and the basic blocks are the subsequent nodes in the flow of execution. 

You can visualize this graph using various tools that support DOT format, such as Graphviz.
