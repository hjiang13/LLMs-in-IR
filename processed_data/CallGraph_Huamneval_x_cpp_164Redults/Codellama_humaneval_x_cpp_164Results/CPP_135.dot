Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can analyze the call graph. The call graph describes the functions and their relationships, specifically which functions call which other functions.

From the provided IR code, we have the following function declarations and calls:

1. The function `_Z11can_arrangeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` is defined and it contains a call to `@llvm.umax.i64`.

Hereâ€™s the extracted call graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=ellipse];
    _Z11can_arrangeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE [label="_Z11can_arrangeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];
    llvm_umax_i64 [label="llvm.umax.i64"];

    // Edges
    _Z11can_arrangeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE -> llvm_umax_i64;
}
```

In the above DOT representation:
- The nodes represent the functions, with `_Z11can_arrangeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` being the defined function and `llvm.umax.i64` being the external function it calls.
- The directed edge (`->`) indicates that `_Z11can_arrangeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` calls `llvm.umax.i64`. 

You can visualize this graph using various graph visualization tools that support the DOT format.
