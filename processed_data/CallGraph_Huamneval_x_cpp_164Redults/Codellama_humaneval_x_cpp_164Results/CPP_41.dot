Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can identify a single function, which is `car_race_collision`. Since there are no calls to other functions within the provided code, the call graph will reflect only this function as a node without any edges.

Here's the call graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Node representing the function
    car_race_collision [label="car_race_collision"];

    // No edges since there are no calls to other functions
}
```

In this representation, we have a single node representing the function `car_race_collision`, and no edges since it does not call any other functions. If there were additional functions or calls within the IR code, they would be included as additional nodes and edges in the graph.
