Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can extract the function and control flow information to create a call graph in the DOT format. In this case, there is only one function defined (`_Z20largest_prime_factori`), and we can outline the basic blocks and their connections as nodes and edges.

Here’s the corresponding DOT representation for the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes representing each basic block
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="Entry"];
    block3 [label="Block 3"];
    block10 [label="Block 10"];
    block12 [label="Block 12"];
    block19 [label="Block 19"];
    
    // Edges representing control flow between basic blocks
    entry -> block3;
    block3 -> block10;
    block3 -> block12;
    block10 -> block19;
    block12 -> block12; // Loop back to Block 12
    block12 -> block19;
    block19 -> block10; // Loop back to Block 10
    block19 -> block3;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each basic block is represented as a node. I’ve given them labels corresponding to their block numbers.
- **Edges**: Directed edges indicate the flow of control from one block to another based on the branches and jumps in the IR code. 

This representation captures the structure and flow of the function without detailing the individual instructions in each block.
