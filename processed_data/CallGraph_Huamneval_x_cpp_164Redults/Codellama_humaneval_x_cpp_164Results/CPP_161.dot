Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can construct a call graph in the DOT format. This graph will include the functions defined in the IR and their call relationships.

Here's the generated DOT file format for the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    solve [label="_Z5solveNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE"];
    lifetime_start_1 [label="llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8"];
    lifetime_end_1 [label="llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8"];
    mem_copy [label="llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64"];
    string_create [label="_ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE9_M_createERmm"];
    string_replace [label="_ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE14_M_replace_auxEmmmc"];
    delete [label="_ZdlPv"];
    personality [label="__gxx_personality_v0"];
    noalias_decl [label="llvm.experimental.noalias.scope.decl"];
    
    // Edges
    solve -> lifetime_start_1;
    solve -> lifetime_end_1;
    solve -> mem_copy;
    solve -> string_create;
    solve -> string_replace;
    solve -> delete;
    solve -> personality;
    solve -> noalias_decl;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each function is represented as a node with its mangled name as the label.
- The edges represent calls made from the `solve` function to other functions.
- The nodes are designed to be rectangular (box shape) for clarity.
- The function names are represented in their mangled form, as they appear in the IR code.

You can visualize this graph using any tool that supports the DOT format, such as Graphviz.
