To create a call graph from the provided IR code in a dot format, we need to identify the function calls made within the code. The IR code includes one defined function and several declared functions. The main function of interest is `_Z10string_xorNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEES4_`, which contains calls to other functions.

Here's the analysis of the calls made in the provided IR code:

1. The defined function `_Z10string_xorNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEES4_` calls the following functions:
   - `_ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE9_M_mutateEmmPKcm`
   - `_ZdlPv`
   - It also refers to `@__gxx_personality_v0`, but this is typically an internal function used for exception handling in C++ and doesn't need to be included in the call graph.

Based on this analysis, we can represent the call graph in the dot format as follows:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Defining nodes for the functions
    node [shape=ellipse];

    // Function nodes
    _Z10string_xorNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEES4_ [label="_Z10string_xorNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEES4_"];
    _ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE9_M_mutateEmmPKcm [label="_ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE9_M_mutateEmmPKcm"];
    _ZdlPv [label="_ZdlPv"];

    // Defining edges for calls
    _Z10string_xorNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEES4_ -> _ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE9_M_mutateEmmPKcm;
    _Z10string_xorNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEES4_ -> _ZdlPv;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each function is represented as a node.
- The edges represent calls from the calling function to the called functions.
- The labels provide a clear identification of the functions involved in the calls. 

You can visualize this graph using graph visualization tools that support dot format, such as Graphviz.
