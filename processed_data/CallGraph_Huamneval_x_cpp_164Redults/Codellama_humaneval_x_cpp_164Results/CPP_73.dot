Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, the function defined is `_Z15smallest_changeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`. The control flow is represented using basic blocks, which can be derived from the `br` (branch) instructions and the labels that follow them.

Hereâ€™s a simplified representation of the call graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    node [shape=box];

    // Function nodes
    smallest_change [label="_Z15smallest_changeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];

    // Edges (function calls)
    // In this provided IR, there are no function calls to other functions.
    // Thus, there would be no edges to represent function calls.
}
```

Since the provided IR code does not show any calls to other functions within the `_Z15smallest_changeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` function, the call graph only contains the node for this function and no edges. 

If there were other functions called within this function, you would add additional nodes and edges corresponding to those function calls.
