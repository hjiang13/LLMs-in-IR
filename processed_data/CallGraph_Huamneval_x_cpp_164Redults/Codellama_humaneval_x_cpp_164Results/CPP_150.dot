Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can extract the function definition and its control flow to create a call graph. The IR code defines a single function, `_Z6x_or_yiii`, which does not appear to call any other functions within its body.

Here is the corresponding dot file representation for the call graph based on the provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Function nodes
    node [shape=box];
    _Z6x_or_yiii;

    // Edges
    // No function calls found in the provided IR code
}
```

In this case, the function `_Z6x_or_yiii` is the only node in the graph, and since there are no function calls to other functions, there are no edges in the call graph. If there were other function calls, they would be represented as edges connecting the caller to the callee.
