Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can extract the function calls to create a call graph. The function defined in the code is `right_angle_triangle`, which calls the external function `llvm.fabs.f32`. 

Here is the call graph represented in the DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    right_angle_triangle [label="right_angle_triangle"];
    llvm_fabs_f32 [label="llvm.fabs.f32"];

    // Edges
    right_angle_triangle -> llvm_fabs_f32;
}
```

In this graph:
- `right_angle_triangle` is the node for the defined function.
- `llvm_fabs_f32` is the node for the external function being called.
- The directed edge from `right_angle_triangle` to `llvm_fabs_f32` indicates that `right_angle_triangle` calls `llvm.fabs.f32`.
