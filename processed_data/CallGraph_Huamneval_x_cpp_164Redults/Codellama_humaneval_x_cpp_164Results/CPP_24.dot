Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can analyze the call graph and represent it in the DOT format. The IR code defines a single function, `_Z15largest_divisori`, which does not appear to call any other functions. Thus, the call graph will simply consist of this function as a node.

Here is the corresponding DOT representation of the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    "largest_divisori" [label="_Z15largest_divisori"];

    // Edges
    // Since there are no calls to other functions, no edges are required.
}
```

In this output:
- The node "largest_divisori" represents the function defined in the IR code.
- There are no edges since this function does not call any other functions. 

If there were other functions or calls in the IR code, they would be included as additional nodes and edges in this graph.
