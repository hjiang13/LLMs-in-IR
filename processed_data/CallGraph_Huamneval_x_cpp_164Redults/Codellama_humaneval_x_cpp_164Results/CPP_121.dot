Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can derive the call graph in the DOT format. The call graph consists of nodes representing functions and directed edges representing function calls. 

In the given IR code, we can identify the following functions:

1. `_Z9solutionsSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` (the main function)
2. `llvm.umax.i64`
3. `llvm.vector.reduce.add.v4i32`

Here is the representation of the call graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes representing functions
    node [shape=box];
    solutions [label="_Z9solutionsSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];
    llvm_umax [label="llvm.umax.i64"];
    llvm_vector_reduce [label="llvm.vector.reduce.add.v4i32"];

    // Edges representing function calls
    solutions -> llvm_umax;
    solutions -> llvm_vector_reduce;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Nodes**: Each node in the graph corresponds to a function. The labels of the nodes are the mangled names of the functions as seen in the IR code.
- **Edges**: Directed edges are drawn from the calling function to the called function, indicating the call relationships.

You can visualize this DOT representation using graph visualization tools that support the DOT format.
