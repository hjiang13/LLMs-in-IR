Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can extract the function calls and construct a call graph in DOT format. The primary function defined is `_Z15starts_one_endsi`, and it calls the function `@llvm.vector.reduce.mul.v4i32`. 

Hereâ€™s the corresponding DOT representation of the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Define nodes
    node [shape=box];
    starts_one_endsi [label="_Z15starts_one_endsi"];
    llvm_vector_reduce_mul_v4i32 [label="@llvm.vector.reduce.mul.v4i32"];

    // Define edges (calls)
    starts_one_endsi -> llvm_vector_reduce_mul_v4i32;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each function is represented as a node in the graph. The main function `_Z15starts_one_endsi` and the declared function `@llvm.vector.reduce.mul.v4i32` are included.
- **Edges**: There is a directed edge from `_Z15starts_one_endsi` to `@llvm.vector.reduce.mul.v4i32`, indicating that the former calls the latter. 

This representation succinctly captures the relationships between the functions in your IR code.
