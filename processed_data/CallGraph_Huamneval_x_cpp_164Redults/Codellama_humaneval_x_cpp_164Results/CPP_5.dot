Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can extract the function calls to create a call graph. Below is the representation of the call graph in the DOT format, which includes nodes for each function and edges for each call between functions.

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    intersperse [label="_Z11intersperseSt6vectorIiSaIiEEi"];
    llvm_memset [label="llvm.memset.p0i8.i64"];
    gxx_personality [label="__gxx_personality_v0"];
    delete [label="_ZdlPv"];
    throw_length_error [label="_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc"];
    new [label="_Znwm"];
    memmove [label="llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64"];
    
    // Edges (Function Calls)
    intersperse -> llvm_memset;
    intersperse -> new;
    intersperse -> throw_length_error;
    intersperse -> delete;
    intersperse -> memmove;
    intersperse -> gxx_personality;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each function is represented as a node in the graph.
- The edges indicate calls made from one function to another.
- The function `_Z11intersperseSt6vectorIiSaIiEEi` (which is a mangled name representing the `intersperse` function) is the main function that calls several other functions.
- The other functions (`llvm_memset`, `__gxx_personality_v0`, `_ZdlPv`, `_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc`, and `_Znwm`) are called from within `intersperse`.

You can use this DOT format with Graphviz to visualize the call graph.
