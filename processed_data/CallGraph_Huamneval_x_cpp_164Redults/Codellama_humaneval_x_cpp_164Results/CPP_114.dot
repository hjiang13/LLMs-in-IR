Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can analyze the control flow and construct a call graph in the specified dot format. In this case, the given IR contains a single function, `_Z14minSubArraySumSt6vectorIxSaIxEE`, which is the only node in our call graph.

Here is the call graph in dot format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node1 [label="_Z14minSubArraySumSt6vectorIxSaIxEE"];

    // Edges
    // Currently, there are no function calls to other functions within the given IR code.
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Node**: The only node represents the function defined in the IR code.
- **Edges**: There are no edges since the provided IR code does not show any calls to other functions. If there were calls to other functions, they would be represented as edges from the calling function to the called function(s).

You can use this dot format to visualize the call graph using graph visualization tools such as Graphviz.
