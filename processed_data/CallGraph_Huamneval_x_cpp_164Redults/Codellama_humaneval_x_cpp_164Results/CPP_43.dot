Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can extract the function definitions and their calls to create a call graph. In this case, we have one function defined (`_Z17pairs_sum_to_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`) that makes a call to another function (`@llvm.umax.i64`). 

Here is the call graph represented in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    _Z17pairs_sum_to_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE [label="_Z17pairs_sum_to_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];
    llvm_umax_i64 [label="@llvm.umax.i64"];

    // Edges
    _Z17pairs_sum_to_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE -> llvm_umax_i64;
}
```

### Explanation:
- The graph is directed, and each function is represented as a node.
- The edge from `_Z17pairs_sum_to_zeroSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` to `@llvm.umax.i64` indicates that the first function calls the second function.
- The labels on the nodes are the names of the functions, which are usually mangled in C++ but can be demangled for better readability if necessary.
