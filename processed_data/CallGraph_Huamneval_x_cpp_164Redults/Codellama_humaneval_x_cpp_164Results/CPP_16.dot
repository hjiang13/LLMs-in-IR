Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can analyze the function calls and construct a call graph in the DOT format. The graph will represent the relationships between the functions, showing which functions call others.

Here's the call graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    "_Z25count_distinct_charactersNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE" [label="_Z25count_distinct_charactersNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE"];
    "tolower" [label="tolower"];
    "_ZdlPv" [label="_ZdlPv"];
    "_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc" [label="_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc"];
    "_Znwm" [label="_Znwm"];
    "llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64" [label="llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64"];

    // Edges
    "_Z25count_distinct_charactersNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE" -> "tolower";
    "_Z25count_distinct_charactersNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE" -> "_ZdlPv";
    "_Z25count_distinct_charactersNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE" -> "_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc";
    "_Z25count_distinct_charactersNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE" -> "_Znwm";
    "_Z25count_distinct_charactersNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE" -> "llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64";
}
```

### Explanation:

- Each function is represented as a node.
- The `label` attributes of the nodes show the function names.
- The directed edges (`->`) indicate calls from one function to another.
- The function `_Z25count_distinct_charactersNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE` is the primary function in this IR, and it calls several other functions: `tolower`, `_ZdlPv`, `_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc`, `_Znwm`, and `llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64`. 

This representation allows for a visual understanding of the call hierarchy and the relationships between the functions in the program.
