To generate a call graph from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we need to identify the functions defined and called within it. In the provided code, there is only one function defined: `triangle_areaff`. It does not call any other function, so the call graph will be relatively simple.

Below is the DOT format representation of the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    triangle_areaff [label="_Z13triangle_areaff"];

    // Edges
    // No calls to other functions
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: The only node is `triangle_areaff`, which is the defined function.
- **Edges**: There are no edges since `triangle_areaff` does not call any other functions.

This is a straightforward representation of the call graph based on the provided IR code. If there were additional functions or calls, they would be represented with additional nodes and edges accordingly.
