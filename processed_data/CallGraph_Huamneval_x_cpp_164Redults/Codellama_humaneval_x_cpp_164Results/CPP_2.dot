Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can extract the functions and their relationships to create a call graph. In this case, there is only one function defined: `truncate_number`. Since there are no calls to other functions, the call graph will only reflect this single function.

Hereâ€™s the call graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    node [shape=rectangle];

    // Function Nodes
    truncate_number [label="_Z15truncate_numberf"];

    // Edges (function calls)
    // In this case, there are no function calls, so no edges are added.
}
```

In this DOT representation:
- We define a directed graph (`digraph`).
- We create a node for the `truncate_number` function.
- Since there are no calls to other functions, there are no edges in the graph. 

If you have more functions or calls within the IR code, please provide that information for a more comprehensive call graph.
