To create a call graph from the given Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will identify the functions and their calls. Based on the provided IR, we can see the following function definitions and calls:

1. The main function defined is:
   - `_Z8exchangeB5cxx11St6vectorIiSaIiEES1_`
   
2. The following functions are called within the main function:
   - `@llvm.umax.i64`
   - `@llvm.vector.reduce.add.v4i32`
   - `@llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64`
   - `@__gxx_personality_v0`

Based on this, we can represent the call graph in the DOT format as follows:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    "_Z8exchangeB5cxx11St6vectorIiSaIiEES1_" [label="_Z8exchangeB5cxx11St6vectorIiSaIiEES1_"];
    "@llvm.umax.i64" [label="@llvm.umax.i64"];
    "@llvm.vector.reduce.add.v4i32" [label="@llvm.vector.reduce.add.v4i32"];
    "@llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64" [label="@llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64"];
    "@__gxx_personality_v0" [label="@__gxx_personality_v0"];

    // Edges
    "_Z8exchangeB5cxx11St6vectorIiSaIiEES1_" -> "@llvm.umax.i64";
    "_Z8exchangeB5cxx11St6vectorIiSaIiEES1_" -> "@llvm.vector.reduce.add.v4i32";
    "_Z8exchangeB5cxx11St6vectorIiSaIiEES1_" -> "@llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64";
    "_Z8exchangeB5cxx11St6vectorIiSaIiEES1_" -> "@__gxx_personality_v0";
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each function is represented as a node in the graph.
- The arrows (edges) represent the calls from the main function to the other functions.
- The labels of the nodes are the names of the functions, which helps in identifying the flow of calls visually.

This representation provides a clear view of the call relationships in the provided IR code.
