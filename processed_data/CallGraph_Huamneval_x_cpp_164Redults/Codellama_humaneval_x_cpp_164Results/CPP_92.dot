Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can analyze the function calls and construct a call graph. The code includes one defined function (`_Z7any_intfff`) and a declared function (`@llvm.round.f32`). 

Here's how the call graph can be represented in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Define nodes for the functions
    node [shape=rectangle];

    // Nodes
    _Z7any_intfff [label="_Z7any_intfff"];
    @llvm.round.f32 [label="@llvm.round.f32"];

    // Edges representing function calls
    _Z7any_intfff -> @llvm.round.f32;
    _Z7any_intfff -> @llvm.round.f32;
    _Z7any_intfff -> @llvm.round.f32;
}
```

### Explanation:
- The node `_Z7any_intfff` corresponds to the defined function in the IR code.
- The node `@llvm.round.f32` corresponds to the declared function.
- Edges from `_Z7any_intfff` to `@llvm.round.f32` indicate that the defined function makes calls to the declared function three times, as evidenced by the three `tail call` instructions in the IR code. 

This representation provides a clear view of the call relationships within the functions as specified in the IR code.
