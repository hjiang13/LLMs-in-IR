To generate the call graph from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can analyze the function definitions and their relationships. The given IR code only defines one function, `fizz_buzz`, and does not contain any function calls to other functions. Therefore, the call graph will consist of a single node for the function.

Here is the call graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    node [shape=box];
    
    // Nodes
    fizz_buzz [label="_Z9fizz_buzzi(i32)"];

    // Edges
    // Since there are no calls to other functions, there are no edges.
}
```

In this graph:
- `fizz_buzz` is represented as a node.
- There are no edges because there are no calls to other functions in the provided IR code. 

If there were additional functions or calls within `fizz_buzz`, they would have been added as additional nodes and edges accordingly.
