Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can identify the function defined and its control flow. Here's the call graph in DOT format. Since the provided code contains only one function (`_Z8is_boredNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`), the call graph will only include that function along with the structure of its control flow.

Here is the representation in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Node for the function
    node [shape=box];

    // Function Node
    Function_is_bored [label="_Z8is_boredNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE"];

    // Basic block labels based on the IR code
    Block_Entry [label="Entry"];
    Block_5 [label="5"];
    Block_10 [label="10"];
    Block_12 [label="12"];
    Block_18 [label="18"];
    Block_24 [label="24"];
    Block_26 [label="26"];
    Block_41 [label="41"];
    Block_42 [label="42"];
    Block_58 [label="58"];
    Block_59 [label="59"];

    // Edges representing control flow
    Function_is_bored -> Block_Entry;
    Block_Entry -> Block_5;
    Block_5 -> Block_10;
    Block_5 -> Block_12;
    Block_12 -> Block_18;
    Block_12 -> Block_24;
    Block_10 -> Block_26;
    Block_26 -> Block_41;
    Block_26 -> Block_42;
    Block_41 -> Block_42;
    Block_42 -> Block_58;
    Block_58 -> Block_59;
    Block_59 -> Block_12;
    Block_59 -> Block_26;
}
```

In this graph representation:
- Each basic block is represented as a node.
- The edges indicate the flow of control between the blocks (e.g., branching and jumps).
- The function itself is represented as a separate node that points to the entry block.

This graph can help visualize the flow of the program based on the provided IR code.
