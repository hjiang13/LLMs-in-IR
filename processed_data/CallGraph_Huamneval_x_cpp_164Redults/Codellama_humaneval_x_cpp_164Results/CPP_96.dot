To represent the call graph based on the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we will identify the functions and their relationships (calls) to generate a DOT format output. Here is the call graph representation based on the functions found in the IR code:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    _Z11count_up_toi;
    _ZdlPv;
    _ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc;
    _Znwm;
    llvm.memset.p0i8.i64;
    llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64;
    __gxx_personality_v0;

    // Edges (function calls)
    _Z11count_up_toi -> llvm.memset.p0i8.i64;
    _Z11count_up_toi -> _Znwm;
    _Z11count_up_toi -> _ZdlPv;
    _Z11count_up_toi -> _ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc;
    _Z11count_up_toi -> llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64;

    // Personality function
    _Z11count_up_toi -> __gxx_personality_v0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- The graph starts with the function `_Z11count_up_toi`, which is the main function in the provided IR code.
- It calls several other functions, which are represented as nodes in the graph.
- Each function is connected by directed edges to represent the calls made within `_Z11count_up_toi`.
- The functions `_ZdlPv`, `_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc`, `_Znwm`, and the LLVM intrinsics `llvm.memset.p0i8.i64` and `llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64` are included as nodes since they are direct calls from `_Z11count_up_toi`.

The output can be used with graph visualization tools that support the DOT format, such as Graphviz.
