Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, the call graph can be generated by extracting the function calls and their relationships. Below is the output in DOT format, which represents the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    encrypt [label="_Z7encryptNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE"];
    llvm_lifetime_start [label="llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8"];
    llvm_lifetime_end [label="llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8"];
    operator_new [label="_ZdlPv"];
    basic_string_create [label="_ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE9_M_createERmm"];
    memcpy [label="llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64"];
    basic_string_replace [label="_ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE14_M_replace_auxEmmmc"];
    
    // Edges
    encrypt -> llvm_lifetime_start;
    encrypt -> llvm_lifetime_end;
    encrypt -> operator_new;
    encrypt -> basic_string_create;
    encrypt -> memcpy;
    encrypt -> basic_string_replace;

    // Note: Additional control flow edges can be added if needed, but the requests specify not to include the content of each basic block.
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each function is represented as a node in the graph.
- The edges represent calls made from one function to another.
- The node labels correspond to the mangled names of the functions as they appear in the IR.
