Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, I will create a call graph in DOT format. The primary function defined is `_Z7minPathSt6vectorIS_IiSaIiEESaIS1_EEi`, and it calls several other functions including `@llvm.umax.i64`, `@llvm.memset.p0i8.i64`, `@llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64`, `@__gxx_personality_v0`, `_ZdlPv`, and `_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc`. Hereâ€™s how the call graph would look in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    "main" [label="main"];
    "_Z7minPathSt6vectorIS_IiSaIiEESaIS1_EEi" [label="_Z7minPathSt6vectorIS_IiSaIiEESaIS1_EEi"];
    "@llvm.umax.i64" [label="@llvm.umax.i64"];
    "@llvm.memset.p0i8.i64" [label="@llvm.memset.p0i8.i64"];
    "@llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64" [label="@llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64"];
    "@__gxx_personality_v0" [label="@__gxx_personality_v0"];
    "_ZdlPv" [label="_ZdlPv"];
    "_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc" [label="_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc"];
    "_Znwm" [label="_Znwm"];

    // Edges
    "_Z7minPathSt6vectorIS_IiSaIiEESaIS1_EEi" -> "@llvm.umax.i64";
    "_Z7minPathSt6vectorIS_IiSaIiEESaIS1_EEi" -> "@llvm.memset.p0i8.i64";
    "_Z7minPathSt6vectorIS_IiSaIiEESaIS1_EEi" -> "@llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64";
    "_Z7minPathSt6vectorIS_IiSaIiEESaIS1_EEi" -> "@__gxx_personality_v0";
    "_Z7minPathSt6vectorIS_IiSaIiEESaIS1_EEi" -> "_ZdlPv";
    "_Z7minPathSt6vectorIS_IiSaIiEESaIS1_EEi" -> "_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc";
    "_Z7minPathSt6vectorIS_IiSaIiEESaIS1_EEi" -> "_Znwm";
}
```

### Explanation:
1. Each function is represented as a node.
2. The main function `_Z7minPathSt6vectorIS_IiSaIiEESaIS1_EEi` is the entry point, and it calls several other functions.
3. The arrows (edges) show the calling relationships between the functions.
4. The node labels are the function signatures, which are indicative of their types based on the IR code.

Make sure to replace `"main"` with the actual entry function if provided or inferred from the context. If there is a main function or other significant entry points, they should be included in the graph as well.
