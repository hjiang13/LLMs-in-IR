To represent the call graph of the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in a DOT format, we will identify the functions that are defined and declared, and show the relationships (i.e., calls) between them. 

In the provided IR code, the following functions are defined or declared:

1. **Defined Function:**
   - `_Z9factorizei` 

2. **Declared Functions (which are called within the defined function):**
   - `@llvm.memset.p0i8.i64`
   - `@__gxx_personality_v0`
   - `_ZdlPv`
   - `_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc`
   - `_Znwm`
   - `@llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64`

Based on this information, we can construct a simple DOT representation of the call graph.

Here is the output in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    _Z9factorizei;
    @llvm.memset.p0i8.i64;
    @__gxx_personality_v0;
    _ZdlPv;
    _ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc;
    _Znwm;
    @llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64;

    // Edges (function calls)
    _Z9factorizei -> @llvm.memset.p0i8.i64;
    _Z9factorizei -> @__gxx_personality_v0;
    _Z9factorizei -> _ZdlPv;
    _Z9factorizei -> _ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc;
    _Z9factorizei -> _Znwm;
    _Z9factorizei -> @llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64;
}
```

This representation captures the function `_Z9factorizei` and the functions it calls, forming a directed graph where arrows indicate the flow of control from calling functions to called functions.
