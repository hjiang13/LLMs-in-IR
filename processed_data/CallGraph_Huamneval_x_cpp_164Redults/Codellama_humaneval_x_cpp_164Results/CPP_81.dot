The Call Graph for the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code can be represented in the DOT format, which is commonly used for graph visualization. Below is the representation of the call graph based on the functions defined and the calls made within the given IR code:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    "main" [label="main"];
    "numerical_letter_grade" [label="_Z22numerical_letter_gradeB5cxx11St6vectorIfSaIfEE"];
    "vector_destructor" [label="_ZNSt6vectorINSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEESaIS5_EED2Ev"];
    "vector_realloc_insert" [label="_ZNSt6vectorINSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEESaIS5_EE17_M_realloc_insertIJS5_EEEvN9__gnu_cxx17__normal_iteratorIPS5_S7_EEDpOT_"];
    "llvm_memset" [label="@llvm.memset.p0i8.i64"];
    "llvm_lifetime_start" [label="@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8"];
    "llvm_lifetime_end" [label="@llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8"];
    "malloc" [label="_Znwm"];
    "free" [label="_ZdlPv"];
    "throw_length_error" [label="_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc"];

    // Edges
    "numerical_letter_grade" -> "vector_destructor";
    "numerical_letter_grade" -> "vector_realloc_insert";
    "vector_destructor" -> "llvm_lifetime_start";
    "vector_destructor" -> "llvm_lifetime_end";
    "vector_realloc_insert" -> "llvm_memset";
    "vector_realloc_insert" -> "free";
    "vector_realloc_insert" -> "malloc";
    "vector_realloc_insert" -> "throw_length_error";
    
    // Additional calls and dependencies can be added here based on analysis
}
```

### Explanation:

- Each node represents a function in the provided IR code.
- The edges represent the calls between these functions.
- The function names are derived from the mangled names in the IR code, which represent their respective definitions and usages.
- The function `main` is assumed as an entry point based on typical C++ programs; however, it wasn't explicitly defined in the IR provided, but the presence of other functions suggests it may exist.
- The `llvm_memset`, `llvm_lifetime_start`, `llvm_lifetime_end`, `malloc`, and `free` are standard functions for memory management and are included based on their presence in the IR code.
