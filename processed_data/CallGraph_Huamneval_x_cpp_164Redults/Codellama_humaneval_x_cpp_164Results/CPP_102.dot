Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can identify the function and the control flow between the basic blocks to create a call graph. In this case, we only have one function: `_Z10choose_numii`.

Here's the representation of the call graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    node [shape=box];

    // Function Node
    _Z10choose_numii [label="_Z10choose_numii"];

    // Basic Block Nodes
    B2 [label="Basic Block %2"];
    B4 [label="Basic Block %4"];
    B9 [label="Basic Block %9"];
    B12 [label="Basic Block %12"];

    // Edges between Basic Blocks
    B2 -> B4;
    B4 -> B9;
    B4 -> B12;
    B2 -> B12; // Directly from %2 to %12
    B9 -> B12;
}
```

### Explanation:
- The graph starts with the function node `_Z10choose_numii`.
- The basic blocks are represented as nodes: `%2`, `%4`, `%9`, and `%12`.
- Directed edges represent the control flow between these basic blocks, based on the branching and control transfer instructions in the IR code.

You can visualize this graph using any DOT file viewer to see the structure and flow of the function.
