Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can analyze it to generate a call graph. Since the provided IR code only contains a single function definition (`_Z3addii`), the call graph will have just one node representing this function. 

Here is the call graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    _Z3addii [label="_Z3addii"];

    // Edges
    // Since there are no calls to other functions, there are no edges
}
```

In this case, the function `_Z3addii` does not call any other functions, so there are no edges in the graph. If there were additional functions or calls present in the IR code, we would include them as nodes and edges accordingly.
