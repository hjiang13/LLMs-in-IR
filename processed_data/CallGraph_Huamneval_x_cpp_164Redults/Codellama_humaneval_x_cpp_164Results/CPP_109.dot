Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can extract the function definitions and their calls to create a call graph. In your case, there is one function defined: `@_Z13move_one_ballSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`, which calls `@llvm.vector.reduce.add.v4i32`.

Here's the call graph represented in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Function nodes
    node [shape=box];
    move_one_ball [label="move_one_ball(vector<int,allocator<int>>*)"];
    llvm_vector_reduce_add [label="llvm.vector.reduce.add.v4i32(<4 x i32>)"];

    // Edges representing function calls
    move_one_ball -> llvm_vector_reduce_add;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each function is represented as a node. The label of the node describes the function name and its parameters for clarity.
- **Edges**: Directed edges represent the calls made within the function. In this case, `move_one_ball` calls `llvm.vector.reduce.add.v4i32`.

If you have any other functions defined or additional calls, please provide that information, and we can expand the call graph accordingly.
