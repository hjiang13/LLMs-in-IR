Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can derive the call graph. In this case, there is only one function defined: `_Z8sum_to_ni`. Since there are no calls to other functions in the provided code snippet, the call graph will only have a single node representing this function.

Here is the output in the DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    node [shape=box];
    "_Z8sum_to_ni" [label="_Z8sum_to_ni"];
}
```

### Explanation:
- The `digraph CallGraph` line initializes a directed graph named `CallGraph`.
- The `node [shape=box];` line specifies the shape of the nodes in the graph.
- The single node `"_Z8sum_to_ni"` represents the function defined in the IR code.
- There are no edges since this function does not call any other functions. 

If there were more functions or calls to other functions, we would add additional nodes and edges accordingly.
