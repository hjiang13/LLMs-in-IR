To create the call graph from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will extract the function definitions and their calls. The relevant functions in this IR code are:

1. `_Z7longestSt6vectorINSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEESaIS5_EE`
2. `_ZdlPv`
3. `_ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE9_M_assignERKS4_`
4. `__gxx_personality_v0`

Based on this analysis, we can construct the call graph in the DOT format. The graph will contain nodes for each function and edges for the calls made between them. Here's the representation:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Function nodes
    node [shape=box];
    longest [label="_Z7longestSt6vectorINSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEESaIS5_EE"];
    operator_delete [label="_ZdlPv"];
    assign [label="_ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE9_M_assignERKS4_"];
    personality [label="__gxx_personality_v0"];

    // Edges representing function calls
    longest -> assign; // Call to _ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE9_M_assignERKS4_
    longest -> operator_delete; // Call to _ZdlPv
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each node represents a function defined in the IR code.
- **Edges**: Directed edges show which functions call which other functions. For example, `_Z7longest...` calls `_ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_string...` and `_ZdlPv`.

You can visualize this graph using a DOT rendering tool, such as Graphviz.
