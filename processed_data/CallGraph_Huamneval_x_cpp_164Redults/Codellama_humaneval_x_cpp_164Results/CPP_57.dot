To construct a call graph from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will identify the functions defined in the code and the calls made to those functions. In this case, the provided code defines a single function, which is `_Z9monotonicSt6vectorIfSaIfEE`, and there are no calls to any other functions within it. 

Since there is only one function in the provided IR, the call graph will be quite simple. Here is the output in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    _Z9monotonicSt6vectorIfSaIfEE [label="_Z9monotonicSt6vectorIfSaIfEE"];

    // Edges
    // No function calls to other functions are present
}
```

In this graph:
- The function `_Z9monotonicSt6vectorIfSaIfEE` is represented as a node.
- There are no edges since there are no calls to other functions. 

If there were additional functions defined or called within the provided IR, they would be included as nodes and connected with edges accordingly.
