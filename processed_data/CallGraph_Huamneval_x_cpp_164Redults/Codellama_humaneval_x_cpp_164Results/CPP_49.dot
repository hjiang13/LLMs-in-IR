Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can extract the call graph in a dot format. The function defined in the IR code is `_Z4modpii` which is the only function present in the code snippet. Given that there are no calls to other functions within this IR code, the call graph would only consist of a single node for this function.

Here is the corresponding dot format output for the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    "Function _Z4modpii";

    // Edges
    // There are no edges since there are no function calls in the provided IR
}
```

In this output:
- There is one node representing the function `_Z4modpii`.
- No edges are present as there are no calls to other functions in the given IR code. 

If there were additional functions or calls within the IR, we would represent them as nodes and edges accordingly.
