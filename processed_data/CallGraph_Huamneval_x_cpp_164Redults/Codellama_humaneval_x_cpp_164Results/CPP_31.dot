Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can analyze the function and its control flow to create a call graph in DOT format. In this case, there is one function defined: `is_primex`. Since there are no calls to other functions within the provided code, the graph will only consist of this one function.

Here is the DOT representation of the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Function Nodes
    is_primex [label="is_primex"];

    // Edges (there are no calls to other functions in the provided IR)
    // If there were function calls, they would be represented here
}
```

In this graph:
- The node `is_primex` represents the function defined in the IR code.
- There are no edges since there are no other functions being called.

If there were additional functions or calls within the IR, they would be included as additional nodes and edges in the format shown above.
