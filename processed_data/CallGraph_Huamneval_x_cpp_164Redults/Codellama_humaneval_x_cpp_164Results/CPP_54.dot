Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can construct a call graph in DOT format. In this case, we have one function defined, `@_Z10same_charsNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEES4_`, which we will represent as a node in the graph. The function also calls another function, `@__gxx_personality_v0`, which we will include as a node.

Hereâ€™s the DOT format representation of the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    main_function [label="_Z10same_charsNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEES4_"];
    personality_function [label="__gxx_personality_v0"];

    // Edges
    main_function -> personality_function;
}
```

### Explanation:
- The graph has two nodes: `main_function` representing the main function `_Z10same_charsNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEES4_` and `personality_function` representing the external function `__gxx_personality_v0`.
- The edge indicates that the `main_function` calls the `personality_function`.
- The node labels are derived from the names in the IR code, and the representation uses the `label` attribute to display the function names clearly.
