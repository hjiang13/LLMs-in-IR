To create a call graph from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we need to analyze the function declarations and calls made. In the given IR code, there is only one function defined, which is `correct_bracketing`. Since there are no other function calls within the code provided, the call graph will be relatively simple. 

Here's how you can represent this in the DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=rectangle];
    correct_bracketing;

    // Edges
    // In this case, there are no calls to other functions from correct_bracketing
}
```

In this graph:
- We have one node for the function `correct_bracketing`.
- There are no edges since there are no calls to other functions within `correct_bracketing`. 

If there were other function calls or definitions in the IR code, they would be added as additional nodes and edges accordingly.
