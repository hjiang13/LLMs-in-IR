To generate a call graph from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we need to identify the function definitions and the function calls within the code. The IR code contains two function definitions: `_Z13encode_cyclicNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE` and `_Z13decode_cyclicNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`, along with calls to external functions such as `@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8`, `@llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8`, and others.

The output will be formatted in the DOT language, which is used for graph visualization. Hereâ€™s the call graph represented in DOT format:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Function definitions as nodes
    node [shape=rectangle];
    EncodeCyclic [label="_Z13encode_cyclicNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE"];
    DecodeCyclic [label="_Z13decode_cyclicNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE"];
    
    // External function calls
    LifetimeStart [label="@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8"];
    LifetimeEnd [label="@llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8"];
    ThrowOutOfRange [label="_ZSt24__throw_out_of_range_fmtPKcz"];
    MAppend [label="_ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE9_M_appendEPKcm"];
    MReplaceAux [label="_ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE14_M_replace_auxEmmmc"];
    Delete [label="_ZdlPv"];
    
    // Edges indicating function calls
    EncodeCyclic -> LifetimeStart;
    EncodeCyclic -> LifetimeEnd;
    EncodeCyclic -> ThrowOutOfRange;
    EncodeCyclic -> MAppend;
    EncodeCyclic -> MReplaceAux;
    EncodeCyclic -> Delete;

    DecodeCyclic -> LifetimeStart;
    DecodeCyclic -> LifetimeEnd;
    DecodeCyclic -> MAppend;
    DecodeCyclic -> MReplaceAux;
    DecodeCyclic -> Delete;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each function is represented as a node in the graph with a label that corresponds to the function's name.
- Edges between nodes represent calls made from one function to another. For example, `EncodeCyclic` calls several functions, which are represented by edges leading to those function nodes.
- The external functions (`@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8`, `@llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8`, etc.) are included as nodes to show that they are called by the defined functions.

This DOT representation can be used with graph visualization tools like Graphviz to render the call graph visually.
