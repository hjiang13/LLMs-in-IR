Based on the provided IR code, we can analyze the call graph and represent it in the DOT format. The main function in the provided IR code is `_Z11sum_squaresSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`, which calls the function `@llvm.umax.i64`. 

Here is the corresponding DOT representation of the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    node [shape=ellipse];

    // Function nodes
    sum_squares [label="_Z11sum_squaresSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];
    llvm_umax [label="@llvm.umax.i64"];

    // Edges representing function calls
    sum_squares -> llvm_umax;
}
```

In this representation:
- Each function is represented as a node.
- The directed edges indicate a call from one function to another.
- The labels reflect the names of the functions as they appear in the IR code. 

Make sure to visualize this DOT representation using a suitable graph visualization tool to see the call graph effectively.
