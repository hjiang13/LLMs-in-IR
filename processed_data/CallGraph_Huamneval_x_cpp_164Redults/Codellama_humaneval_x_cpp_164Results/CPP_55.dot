Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, I will extract the function calls and generate a call graph in the DOT format. In the given IR code, there are two functions: one defined and two declared. The defined function is `_Z3fibi`, while the declared functions are `@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8` and `@llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8`. 

Here is the corresponding DOT representation of the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes representing functions
    node [shape=box];

    _Z3fibi [label="_Z3fibi"];
    llvm_lifetime_start [label="llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8"];
    llvm_lifetime_end [label="llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8"];

    // Edges representing function calls
    _Z3fibi -> llvm_lifetime_start;
    _Z3fibi -> llvm_lifetime_end;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each function is represented as a node in the graph.
- **Edges**: Directed edges connect the caller function to the callee functions, indicating which functions are called by which. In this case, `_Z3fibi` calls `@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8` and `@llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8`.

You can visualize the call graph using graph visualization tools that support DOT format, such as Graphviz.
