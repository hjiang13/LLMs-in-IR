Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can extract the function calls to create a call graph. Below is the representation of the call graph in the DOT format, which includes the functions as nodes and the call relationships as directed edges.

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    _Z3trii;
    @_Znwm;
    @_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc;
    @llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64;
    @_ZdlPv;
    @llvm.memset.p0i8.i64;

    // Edges
    _Z3trii -> @_Znwm;
    _Z3trii -> @llvm.memset.p0i8.i64;
    _Z3trii -> @_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc;
    _Z3trii -> @_ZdlPv;
    _Z3trii -> @llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each function is represented as a node in the graph.
- Directed edges indicate a call from one function to another.
- The primary function in the provided IR is `_Z3trii`, which calls several other functions, specifically the memory allocation, memory set, and error handling functions.
