Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, here is the Call Graph represented in the DOT format. The nodes represent the functions, and the edges represent the calls between them.

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=ellipse];
    make_a_pile [label="_Z11make_a_pilei"];
    __gxx_personality_v0 [label="__gxx_personality_v0"];
    _Znwm [label="_Znwm"];
    __throw_length_error [label="_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc"];
    llvm_memmove [label="llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64"];
    _ZdlPv [label="_ZdlPv"];
    llvm_memset [label="llvm.memset.p0i8.i64"];

    // Edges
    make_a_pile -> _Znwm;
    make_a_pile -> __throw_length_error;
    make_a_pile -> llvm_memmove;
    make_a_pile -> _ZdlPv;
    make_a_pile -> llvm_memset;
    make_a_pile -> __gxx_personality_v0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each function is represented as a node. The function names are transformed into a format suitable for the DOT file (mangled names are shown).
- **Edges**: Arrows show the calls between the functions. For example, `make_a_pile` calls `_Znwm`, `__throw_length_error`, `llvm_memmove`, `_ZdlPv`, and `llvm_memset`.

You can render this graph using tools like Graphviz to visualize the call relationships.
