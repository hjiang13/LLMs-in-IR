Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can extract the functions and their calls to create a call graph in DOT format. Here's the representation for the call graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    "main" [label="main"];
    "_Z3eatiii" [label="_Z3eatiii"];
    "__gxx_personality_v0" [label="__gxx_personality_v0"];
    "_Znwm" [label="_Znwm"];
    "llvm.memset.p0i8.i64" [label="llvm.memset.p0i8.i64"];
    
    // Edges
    "_Z3eatiii" -> "_Znwm";
    "_Z3eatiii" -> "llvm.memset.p0i8.i64";
    "_Z3eatiii" -> "__gxx_personality_v0";
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Represent the functions present in the IR code.
- **Edges**: Indicate the calls made from one function to another. For example, `_Z3eatiii` calls `_Znwm`, `llvm.memset.p0i8.i64`, and `__gxx_personality_v0`.

Note that the main function is included as a placeholder. If there are more functions or a specific main function mentioned in the original code, it would need to be reflected in the nodes and edges accordingly. In this case, we only have the `_Z3eatiii` function and the declared external functions.
