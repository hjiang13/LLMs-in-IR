Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, I have analyzed the function calls and created a call graph in the DOT format. Hereâ€™s the resulting DOT representation:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Function nodes
    node [shape=rectangle];
    
    _Z10derivativeSt6vectorIfSaIfEE [label="_Z10derivativeSt6vectorIfSaIfEE"];
    @llvm.memset.p0i8.i64 [label="@llvm.memset.p0i8.i64"];
    @__gxx_personality_v0 [label="@__gxx_personality_v0"];
    @_ZdlPv [label="@_ZdlPv"];
    @_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc [label="@_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc"];
    @_Znwm [label="@_Znwm"];
    @llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64 [label="@llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64"];
    
    // Edges representing function calls
    _Z10derivativeSt6vectorIfSaIfEE -> @llvm.memset.p0i8.i64;
    _Z10derivativeSt6vectorIfSaIfEE -> @_ZdlPv;
    _Z10derivativeSt6vectorIfSaIfEE -> @_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc;
    _Z10derivativeSt6vectorIfSaIfEE -> @_Znwm;
    _Z10derivativeSt6vectorIfSaIfEE -> @llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Each function in the IR is represented as a node in the graph.
- Edges are drawn to represent function calls, indicating which function calls which other function.
- The labels of the nodes are the names of the functions, and the nodes are rectangular to represent functions in the call graph. 

This DOT format can be used to visualize the call graph using graph visualization tools like Graphviz.
