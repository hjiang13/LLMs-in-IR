Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, the following is the representation of the call graph in the DOT format. In this case, since there’s only one function defined (`_Z17is_multiply_primei`), the graph will consist of a single node for this function. 

Here’s the DOT representation:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Node representing the function
    "is_multiply_prime" [label="is_multiply_prime"];

    // Edges - since there are no calls to other functions in the provided IR,
    // there will be no edges in this case.
}
```

In this representation:
- The graph is directed (`digraph`).
- We have one node labeled `is_multiply_prime` which corresponds to the function defined in the IR code.
- There are no edges since the function does not call any other functions within the provided IR code. 

If there were other functions being called within `is_multiply_prime`, they would also be represented as nodes with edges connecting to them from `is_multiply_prime`.
