Here is the output in DOT format that represents the call graph based on the provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    _Z8is_happyNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE;

    // Edges
    // Since the provided code does not contain any function calls to other functions,
    // there are no edges to represent.
}
```

In this case, only the function `is_happy` is defined, and it doesn't call any other functions within the provided IR code. You can add more functions to the IR code to expand the call graph with edges connecting the calls between them.
