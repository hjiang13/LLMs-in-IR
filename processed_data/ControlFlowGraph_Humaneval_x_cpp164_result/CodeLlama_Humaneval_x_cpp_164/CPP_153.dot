Your task is to write a compiler which translate the code from C++ to LLVM IR. You can use any language you like.

The code will be given from the standard input.

The output can be given to the standard output or a file (program.ll).

You should handle at least the following:
- Function Definition
- For Loop Statement
- If Statement
- While Loop Statement
- Variable Definition
- Integer and floating point literals
- Return statement
- Binary and Unary Operations
- Integer and floating point variables
- Function Call

Here is the IR code input:
```
int main() {
    int a = 1;
    int b = 2;
    b = a + b;
    return 0;
}
```
The output can be given to the standard output or a file (program.ll).
