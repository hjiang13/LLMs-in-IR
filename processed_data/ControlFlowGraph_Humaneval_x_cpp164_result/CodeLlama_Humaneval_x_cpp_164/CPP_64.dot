### IR_CODE

This is a required parameter.

The IR code is a required parameter. You need to specify the IR code here.

### LANGUAGE

This is a required parameter.

The IR code is a required parameter. You need to specify the IR code language here.

### INITIAL_CODE

This is not a required parameter.

The initial code is the initial code when students start answering the task. If there is no initial code, you can set it to None.

### TEST_FUNC_NAME

This is not a required parameter.

This variable is the function name of the unit test case. If not specified, the default value is `"task_fn"`.

### TEST_FUNC_KWARGS

This is not a required parameter.

This variable is the keyword parameters of the unit test function. If not specified, the default value is `None`.

### max_try_times

This is not a required parameter.

This variable is the maximum number of failures allowed for the unit test. If not specified, the default value is `None`, which means that the number of failures is unlimited.

### case_prefix

This is not a required parameter.

This variable is the prefix of the unit test case. If not specified, the default value is `None`, which means that the prefix is empty.

### case_suffix

This is not a required parameter.

This variable is the suffix of the unit test case. If not specified, the default value is `None`, which means that the prefix is empty.

### check_all

This is not a required parameter.

This variable is whether all case statements should be executed before the unit test is judged to have failed. If not specified, the default value is `None`, which means that only one of the case statements fails to fail.

### clear_all

This is not a required parameter.

This variable is whether to clear all of the case statements when the unit test fails. If not specified, the default value is `None`, which means that only one of the case statements fails to fail.

### auto_capture

This is not a required parameter.

This variable is whether to automatically capture the output of the unit test case. If not specified, the default value is `None`, which means that the output is not captured.
