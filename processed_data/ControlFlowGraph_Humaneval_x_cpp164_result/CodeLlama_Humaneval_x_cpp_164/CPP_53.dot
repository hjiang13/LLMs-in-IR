        Nice work! You have solved the problem.
        
        But do you know how to solve this problem more efficiently?
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Based on your solution, you can try to solve the problem in the following ways:
1. Optimize the data structure used for parsing, so that you can reduce the cost of parsing.
2. Optimize the search algorithm, so that you can reduce the cost of traversing nodes.

        I will try it.
