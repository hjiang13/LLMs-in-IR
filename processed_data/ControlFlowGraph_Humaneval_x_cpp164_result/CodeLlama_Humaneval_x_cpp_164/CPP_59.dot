        The output format is dot file including nodes and edges. Don't need to list the content of each basic blocks. Just show the title of each nodes.
        
        Here is your output:
        ```
        digraph {
            Entry[label="Entry", shape=ellipse, style=filled, fillcolor=yellow]
            n1[label="n1", shape=box]
            n2[label="n2", shape=box]
            n3[label="n3", shape=box]
            n4[label="n4", shape=box]
            n5[label="n5", shape=box]
            n6[label="n6", shape=ellipse, style=filled, fillcolor=yellow]
            Entry -> n1
            n1 -> n2
            n2 -> n3
            n3 -> n1
            n1 -> n4
            n4 -> n5
            n5 -> n6
            n2 -> n4
            n3 -> n5
            n4 -> n6
            n5 -> n1
            n5 -> n2
        }
        ```
       Your output is correct. Congrats!
