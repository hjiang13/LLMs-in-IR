<|im_start|>system
Here is your output:
```
digraph G {
    node [shape=box];
    bb0 [label = "bb0: 0->1"];
    bb1 [label = "bb1: 1->2,3"];
    bb2 [label = "bb2: 2->4,5"];
    bb3 [label = "bb3: 3->4"];
    bb4 [label = "bb4: 4->6"];
    bb5 [label = "bb5: 5->6"];
    bb6 [label = "bb6: 6->"];

    bb0 -> bb1;
    bb1 -> bb2;
    bb1 -> bb3;
    bb2 -> bb4;
    bb2 -> bb5;
    bb3 -> bb4;
    bb4 -> bb6;
    bb5 -> bb6;
}
```

        Your output is correct.
        Now I give you a C code program and you give me the control flow graph. 
        
        Here is the C code input:
        ```
        #include <stdio.h>
        int max(int x, int y, int z)
        {
            if (x >= y && x >= z)
            {
                return x;
            }
            else if (y >= x && y >= z)
            {
                return y;
            }
            else
            {
                return z;
            }
        }
        int main()
        {
            int a, b, c;
            printf("Enter three numbers: ");
            scanf("%d%d%d", &a, &b, &c);
            printf("Maximum of the numbers = %d\n", max(a, b, c));
            return 0;
        }
        ```
       Your task is to The output format is dot file including nodes and edges. Don't need to list the content of each basic blocks. Just show the title of each nodes.

<|im_start|>system
Here is your output:
```
digraph G {
    node [shape=box];
    bb0 [label = "bb0: 0->1,2"];
    bb1 [label = "bb1: 1->3"];
    bb2 [label = "bb2: 2->3"];
    bb3 [label = "bb3: 3->4"];
    bb4 [label = "bb4: 4->5"];
    bb5 [label = "bb5: 5->"];

    bb0 -> bb1;
    bb0 -> bb2;

    bb2 -> bb3;
    bb3 -> bb4;
    bb4 -> bb5;
}
```

        Your output is correct.
