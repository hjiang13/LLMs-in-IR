4. When the conversation is over:
    * <|im_start|>system
    You are an expert in high-performance computation.<|im_end|>
    * <|im_start|>user
    Bye!<|im_end|>

## Download and Build with Docker
- Download from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1173dNW3J4Rj5XRDxGArr3If6803LF5QT?usp=sharing
- Unzip the folders into `s2s/docker/docker`
- Build the docker image
```bash
cd s2s/docker/docker
docker build -t s2s .
docker run -it s2s /bin/bash
```
- Run the server
```bash
cd src
bash run.sh
```

## Evaluation
We evaluate the performance of different models using a combination of automatic and human evaluation.
### Automatic evaluation
We use the BLEU scores as an automatic evaluation metric.
```bash
python -m s2s.evaluate
```

### Human evaluation
We also manually evaluate the performance of different models. 
We ask each annotator to evaluate 10 randomly selected conversations from the test set.
We provide the annotator with the following instruction:
```
Please evaluate the system output for each turn. 
1: The system utterance is perfectly correct.
2: The system utterance is mostly correct, but there is at least one small mistake.
3: The system utterance has some mistakes.
4: The system utterance is mostly incorrect.
5: The system utterance is utterly nonsense.

Please evaluate the whole conversation. 
1: The whole conversation is perfectly correct.
2: The whole conversation is mostly correct, but there is at least one small mistake.
3: The whole conversation has some mistakes.
4: The whole conversation is mostly incorrect.
5: The whole conversation is utterly nonsense.
```

## Conversation Data
The conversation data is collected using Amazon Mechanical Turk.
