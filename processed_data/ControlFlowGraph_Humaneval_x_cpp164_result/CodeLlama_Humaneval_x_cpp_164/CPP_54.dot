     That's right. It's very easy to understand.

        It's really hard to me. I don't know about IR code.

     You are an expert in high-performance computation.

        I'm not. I'm just an average student.

     I have good news for you. You don't need to know every detail of IR. You can just use IR as a black box. 
     The most important thing you need to know is that IR is a control flow graph. 
     It's not a general control flow graph. It's a control flow graph which is created from a program.
     So, It has nodes and edges. It doesn't have a loop.
     If you want to get the IR of a program, you can use clang as a front-end to get the IR code.

        What's the difference between a general control flow graph and IR?

     Let's look at the IR code.
     ```
     1:                                                ; preds = %52, %47
        %63 = phi i64 [ %45, %47 ], [ 0, %52 ]
        %64 = phi i8* [ %53, %47 ], [ %59, %52 ]
        %65 = load i8, i8* %64, align 1, !tbaa !11
        %66 = icmp eq i8 %65, %23
        br i1 %66, label %68, label %69
     
     ```
     It's from the IR code you gave me. It is created from a C++ code. Let's look at the C++ code.
     ```
     ...
     if(c1 == c2) {
        if(c1 == c3) {
            if(c1 == c4) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    ...
     ```
     From the C++ code, It looks like that there is a loop. But, it's not.
     Because the loop is unrolled. It's like an unrolled loop.

        I see. I think I understand the difference between a general control flow graph and IR.
        Thank you very much for your kindness.
