You may need to convert the dot file to image with the following command:

```bash
dot -Tpng cfg.dot -o cfg.png
```

### Dataset

We have a small dataset to test your code. It is under the folder `dataset`


### Expected output

The output of your program should be like this:

```bash
# dot file
digraph {
    "1" -> {
        "2"
    }
    "2" -> {
        "1"
    }
}
```

The output of the above example is:

<img src="image/control_flow_graph_example.png" alt="drawing" style="width:600px;"/>

We have a small dataset to test your code. It is under the folder `dataset`.
