<|im_start|>system
Check the following graph:
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
digraph G {
        Entry [shape=doublecircle];
        3 -> 12 [label="True"];
        3 -> 24 [label="False"];
        12 -> 24 [label="True"];
        Entry -> 3 [label="True"];
}
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

        Your output is:
        ```
        digraph G {
            Entry [shape=doublecircle];
            3 -> 12 [label="True"];
            3 -> 24 [label="False"];
            12 -> 24 [label="True"];
            Entry -> 3 [label="True"];
        }
