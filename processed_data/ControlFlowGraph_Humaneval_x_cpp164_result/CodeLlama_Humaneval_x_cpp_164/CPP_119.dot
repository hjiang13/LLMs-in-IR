### Submit your results

1. Make a new folder named with your school ID, e.g. "109XXXXXX"
2. Prepare 4 files. Including the following:
    - `Makefile` to compile your source code.
    - `src/*.c` or `src/*.cpp`
    - `run.sh` to run your program.
    - `result.txt` to store the output.

```
109XXXXXX
    |- Makefile
    |- src
        |- *.c or *.cpp
        |- ...
    |- run.sh
    |- result.txt
```

3. Submit your result

```sh
$ cd 109XXXXXX
$ make
$ ./run.sh
$ tar cvf 109XXXXXX.tar *
$ mv 109XXXXXX.tar ../../
```

### Deadline

### Verify

```sh
$ make verify
```

### Score

```sh
$ make score
```

### Check format

```sh
$ make format
```

### Clean

```sh
$ make clean
```

### Get the docker image

```sh

$ make score
$ make format
$ make clean
```

## Detail

### Project Structure

- `run.sh`

    You can run your program by this script.

- `Makefile`

    You need to implement the `make` command and `make clean` command on this file.

    You can check the format of source code by `make format` command.

    You can check the score of your result by `make score` command.

    You can verify the correctness of your result by `make verify` command.

- `src/*`

    You need to implement your program in this directory.

- `dataset_1`

    You can use the LLVM IR file in this directory as your dataset.

    You can also generate your own dataset by [this link](https://github.com/compiler-f19/hw1-dataset-gen).

- `result.txt`

    You need to store the output of your program in this file.

### Makefile

```
TARGET = run

$(TARGET) : *.c *.cpp

.PHONY : format clean

format :
    clang-format -i -style=google *.h *.c *.cpp

clean :
    rm -f $(TARGET)
```

### Example

You can use the following command to build the example.

```sh
$ make
```

To verify the correctness of your result, you can use the following command.

```sh
$ make verify
```

To check the score of your result, you can use the following command.

```sh
$ make score
```

To check the format of your source code, you can use the following command.

```sh
$ make format
```

To clean up your workspace, you can use the following command.

```sh
$ make clean
```

### Docker

You can also compile your program in a docker container.

The following command can build your docker image.

```sh
$ docker build -t pndni/icc-2022-hw1 .
```

The following command can run your program in a docker container.

```sh
$ docker run -it --rm --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/109XXXXXX,target=/home/student/109XXXXXX pndni/icc-2022-hw1 /bin/bash
```
