Decompiling LLVM IR to C++ is a challenging task, as it's a low-level, platform-independent representation of a program. However, I'll do my best to provide a decompiled version of the IR code in C++.

Here is the decompiled C++ code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cctype>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int x, y;
    ifstream input_file("input_files/CutTheSticks00", ios::in);
    input_file >> x >> y;
    int sticks[x];
    for (int i = 0; i < x; i++) {
        sticks[i] = y;
    }
    int remaining_sticks;
    while (x > 0) {
        remaining_sticks = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < x; i++) {
            if (sticks[i] > 0) {
                sticks[i]--;
                remaining_sticks++;
            }
        }
        cout << remaining_sticks << endl;
        x = remaining_sticks;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
Please note that this decompiled code might not be exactly the original C++ code, as the IR code is a low-level representation that can be optimized, transformed, or even rewritten by the compiler. Additionally, the decompiled code might not preserve the original formatting, comments, or variable names.

If you have any specific questions or concerns about the decompiled code, feel free to ask!
