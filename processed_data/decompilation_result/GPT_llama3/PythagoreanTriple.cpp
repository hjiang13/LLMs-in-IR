After analyzing the IR code, I was able to decompile it into a C++ source code. Here is the decompiled code:
```c
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <sstream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream file("input_files/PythagoreanTriple00");
    if (!file) {
        cout << "Error opening file." << endl;
        return 1;
    }

    long long n = 0, i = 0, j = 0, k = 0;
    file >> n;

    if (n < 2) {
        cout << "1" << endl;
        return 0;
    }

    for (long long a = 1; a * a <= n; a++) {
        for (long long b = a; b * b <= n; b++) {
            long long c = (long long)sqrt(n * (n - a * a) / (b * b));
            if (c * c == (n - a * a - b * b)) {
                cout << a << " " << b << " " << c << endl;
            }
        }
    }

    file.close();
    return 0;
}
```
Note that I assumed the input file is named "input_files/PythagoreanTriple00" and has the same format as in the IR code. You may need to adjust the file path and name accordingly. Also, I used `long long` instead of `i64` as it's a more conventional way to represent 64-bit integers in C++.
