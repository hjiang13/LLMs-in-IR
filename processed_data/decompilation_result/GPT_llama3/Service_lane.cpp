I can help you with that. However, please note that decompiling IR code back into C++ code can be a complex task, and the resulting code may not be exactly the same as the original C++ code that was compiled to IR.

Here is the decompiled C++ code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int x, y, z, w;
    ifstream file("input_files/Service_lane00");
    file >> x >> y >> z >> w;
    cout << "x = " << x << ", y = " << y << ", z = " << z << ", w = " << w << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
Please note that this is just an approximation of the original C++ code, and the actual code may be different. The decompiled code may not include all the original code's functionality, and some parts may be missing or incorrect.
