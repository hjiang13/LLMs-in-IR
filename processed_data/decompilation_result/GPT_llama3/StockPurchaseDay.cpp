I can help you with that. However, please note that LLVM IR is a low-level, platform-independent representation of a program, and decompiling it into a pure C or C++ source code may not always be straightforward or possible. The resulting code may not be identical to the original C++ code that was compiled to generate the IR.

That being said, I can try to decompile the IR code into a C++ source code. Here's the decompiled code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int solve(int n) {
    int suffmn[100005];
    for (int i = 0; i < 100005; i++) {
        suffmn[i] = 0;
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        int arr[i];
        // Read input from file
        ifstream file("input_files/StockPurchaseDay00");
        file >> arr[0];
        for (int j = 1; j < i; j++) {
            file >> arr[j];
        }
        file.close();

        // Calculate suffix minimum
        int suff_min = 0;
        for (int j = 1; j < i; j++) {
            if (arr[j] < suff_min) {
                suff_min = arr[j];
            }
        }

        // Update suffix minimum
        for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            suffmn[j] = suff_min;
            if (j < i - 1 && arr[j] < suffmn[j + 1]) {
                suffmn[j] = arr[j];
            }
        }
    }

    return 0;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    // Read input from file
    ifstream file("input_files/StockPurchaseDay00");
    file >> n;
    file.close();

    solve(n);

    return 0;
}
```
Note that I've made some assumptions about the input file format and the `solve` function implementation based on the IR code. The resulting C++ code may not be exactly the same as the original code that was compiled to generate the IR.
