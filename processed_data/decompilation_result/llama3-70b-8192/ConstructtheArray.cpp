Here is the decompiled C++ source code:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cctype>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    freopen("../input_files/ConstructtheArray", "r", stdin);
    ios_base::Init iosInit;
    cin.sync_with_stdio(false);

    long long n, k, x;
    cin >> n >> k >> x;

    long long dp[510031][3] = {{0}};
    dp[1][0] = 1;

    for (long long i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        for (long long j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
            dp[i][0] += dp[j][0] * dp[i - j][0];
            dp[i][0] %= 1000000007;
        }
    }

    cout << dp[n][0] << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
Note that I had to make some assumptions about the types and variables used in the IR code, as the IR code itself does not provide explicit type information. Additionally, I had to simplify some of the complex expressions and loop structures in the IR code to make them more readable and compilable in C++.
