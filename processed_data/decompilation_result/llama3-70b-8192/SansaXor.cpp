Here is the decompiled C++ source code:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <cstdio>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int i;
    cin >> i;
    if (i > 0) {
        freopen("input_files/SansaXor", "r", stdin);
        i64 j;
        cin >> j;
        i64* k = new i64[j];
        for (i64 l = 0; l < j; l++) {
            cin >> k[l];
            k[l] ^= l;
        }
        cout << endl;
        delete[] k;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
Note that I've made some assumptions about the types and names of variables, as the IR code doesn't provide explicit information about them. Additionally, I've used `i64` as a type for 64-bit integers, as it's commonly used in C++ code.
