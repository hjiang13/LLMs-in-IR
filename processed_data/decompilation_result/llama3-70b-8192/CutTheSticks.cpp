After analyzing the provided LLVM IR code, I was able to decompile it into the following C++ source code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cctype>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream cin("input_files/CutTheSticks");
    int N;
    cin >> N;

    int sticks[4000];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        cin >> sticks[i];
    }

    sort(sticks, sticks + N);

    int previous = sticks[0];
    int count = 1;

    for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
        if (sticks[i] != previous) {
            cout << count << endl;
            previous = sticks[i];
            count = 1;
        } else {
            count++;
        }
    }

    cout << count << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
Note that I had to make some assumptions about the original source code, such as the file input and output operations. Additionally, I had to replace some of the C++ standard library functions with their C counterparts (e.g., `std::sort` with `sort`) to make the code more readable and compilable.

Please note that this decompilation is not perfect, and some parts of the original code might be missing or modified. However, this should give you a good starting point to work with.
