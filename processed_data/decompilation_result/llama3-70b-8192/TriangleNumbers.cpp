After analyzing the provided LLVM IR code, I was able to decompile it into a C++ source code. Here is the resulting code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <locale>

int main() {
    int num;
    std::ifstream file;
    file.open("../input_files/TriangleNumbers");
    if (!file) {
        std::cerr << "Error opening file!" << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
    file >> num;
    int count = num - 1;
    while (count > 0) {
        long long triangle;
        file >> triangle;
        if ((triangle & 1) == 0) {
            triangle /= 2;
            if ((triangle & 1) == 0) {
                std::cout << "3";
            } else {
                std::cout << "2";
            }
        } else {
            std::cout << "4";
        }
        std::cout << std::flush;
        count--;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
Please note that I made some assumptions about the code, such as the file path and the error handling. You may need to adjust these to fit your specific use case.
