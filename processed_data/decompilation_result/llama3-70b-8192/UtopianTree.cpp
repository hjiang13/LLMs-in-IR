After analyzing the provided LLVM IR code, I was able to decompile it into a C++ source code. Here is the decompiled code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <cstdlib>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    short length;
    cin >> length;

    short* tree = new short[length * 2];
    memset(tree, 0, length * 2 * sizeof(short));

    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        cin >> tree[i];
    }

    for (int i = length; i < length * 2; i++) {
        tree[i] = tree[i - length] + 1;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        cout << tree[i] << endl;
    }

    delete[] tree;
    return 0;
}
```
Please note that this decompiled code assumes that the input file contains a single integer `length` on the first line, followed by `length` number of integers on subsequent lines. The program reads these inputs, calculates the Utopian Tree heights, and prints them to the console.

Also, the decompiled code uses `short` data type for the tree heights, as suggested by the IR code. If you need to use a different data type, you can modify the code accordingly.
