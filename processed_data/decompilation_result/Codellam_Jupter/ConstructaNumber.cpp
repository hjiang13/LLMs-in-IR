Here is the C code generated from the provided LLVM IR code:
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdint.h>

typedef struct _IO_FILE FILE;
typedef struct _IO_FILE _IO_FILE;

struct _IO_FILE {
  int dummy;
};

FILE *stdin;
FILE *stdout;
FILE *stderr;

char *__ioinit(void)
{
  static char *init = "../input_files/ConstructaNumber.cpp";
  return init;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  int num1, num2, sum;
  FILE *file;

  file = freopen("../input_files/ConstructaNumber.cpp", "r", stdin);
  if (!file) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Failed to open file\n");
    return 1;
  }

  fscanf(file, "%d", &num1);
  fscanf(file, "%d", &num2);

  sum = num1 + num2;

  printf("The sum of %d and %d is %d\n", num1, num2, sum);

  return 0;
}
```
Note that the generated C code is not a direct translation of the LLVM IR code, but rather a reconstructed version of the original C code that was used to generate the IR. The reconstructed code may not be exactly the same as the original code, but it should be functionally equivalent.
