def generate_c_code(llvm_ir_code):
    # Write your code to generate the C source code from the LLVM IR code here
    return c_source_code
[/PYTHON]

Please note that this is a very challenging task, and it will require a deep understanding of both LLVM IR and C programming languages. Additionally, the generated C code may not be perfect and may require further optimization and debugging.
