Here is the decompiled C++ code for the given LLVM IR:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>

struct _IO_FILE;
struct std::basic_ostream;
struct std::basic_ios;
struct std::ios_base;
struct std::locale;
struct std::locale::facet;
struct std::locale::facet::base;
struct std::ctype;
struct std::num_put;
struct std::num_get;

extern "C" {
void __cxa_atexit(void (*)(void*), void*, void*);
}

extern _IO_FILE* stdin;
extern std::basic_ostream* cout;

int main() {
    _IO_FILE* file = freopen(".str", "r", stdin);
    int x, y, w;
    fscanf(file, "%d %d", &x, &y);
    fscanf(file, "%d %d %d", &x, &y, &w);
    while (x > 0 && y > 0 && w > 0) {
        int abs_x = abs(x);
        int abs_y = abs(y);
        int abs_w = abs(w);

        if (abs_x > abs_y || abs_w > abs_y) {
            continue;
        }

        int temp_x = abs_x;
        int temp_y = abs_w;
        while (temp_x < abs_y) {
            temp_x += abs_x;
            temp_y -= abs_y;
        }

        if (temp_y < 0) {
            continue;
        }

        w += temp_x;
        y += temp_y;

        x++;
    }

    printf("%d %d %d\n", x, y, w);

    return 0;
}
```

Please note that this code is a C++ translation of the given LLVM IR, which represents a program that reads input from a file named ".str" and performs some calculations based on the input. The input format is `x y w`, where `x`, `y`, and `w` are integers. The program calculates the absolute values of `x`, `y`, and `w`, then updates `x` and `y` based on certain conditions involving these absolute values. The program continues this process until the specified conditions are no longer met. Finally, the program prints the updated values of `x`, `y`, and `w` and exits.

The original LLVM IR code includes a significant amount of type information and debug metadata, which are not necessary for the execution of the code and are not included in the provided C++ translation. Additionally, since the actual input file ".str" is not given, you may need to modify the code to provide proper input.
