Here is the decompiled C++ code for the given LLVM IR:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>

int main() {
    std::istream* cin = &std::cin;
    std::basic_istream<char, std::char_traits<char>>& is = *cin;
    std::basic_ostream<char, std::char_traits<char>>& out = std::cout;
    unsigned long long num = 0;
    unsigned long long temp = 0;

    freopen("../input_files/ProjectEulerMultiple3and5", "r", stdin);

    while (true) {
        is >> num;
        if (num == 0)
            break;
        temp = num;
        temp -= 1;
        temp /= 3;
        temp *= 3;
        temp += 1;
        temp *= temp;
        temp /= 2;

        temp -= 1;
        temp /= 5;
        temp *= 5;
        temp += 1;
        temp *= temp;
        temp /= 2;

        temp -= num;
        out << temp << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This C++ code reads integers from the input file `../input_files/ProjectEulerMultiple3and5` and calculates the sum of the series for each integer. The series is defined as:

1. Find the largest multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to the input number `n`. Multiply it by itself, and then divide it by 2.
2. Find the largest multiple of 5 that is less than or equal to the input number `n`. Multiply it by itself, and then divide it by 2.
3. Subtract the second result from the first.

The calculated result is then printed to the console.
