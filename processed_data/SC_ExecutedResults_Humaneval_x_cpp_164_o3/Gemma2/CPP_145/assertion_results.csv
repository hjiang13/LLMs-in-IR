"assert (issame(order_by_points({1, 11, -1, -11, -12}) , {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}));",pass,"let's break down the code and analyze the assertion.

**code analysis**

the function `order_by_points` aims to sort a vector of integers based on the sum of their digits. here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **digit sum calculation:**
   - it iterates through each integer in the input vector `nums`.
   - for each integer:
     - it converts the absolute value of the integer to a string (`w`).
     - it calculates the sum of the digits by iterating through the string representation.
     - it adjusts the sum based on the sign of the original integer (adding for positive, subtracting for negative).
   - the calculated digit sums are stored in the `sumdigit` vector.

2. **sorting:**
   - the code uses a bubble sort algorithm to sort both the `nums` vector (the original integers) and the `sumdigit` vector simultaneously.
   - it compares adjacent elements in `sumdigit`. if they are out of order, it swaps the corresponding elements in both `sumdigit` and `nums`.

3. **return:**
   - the function returns the sorted `nums` vector.

**assertion analysis**

the assertion `assert (issame(order_by_points({1, 11, -1, -11, -12}) , {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}));` checks if the output of `order_by_points` for the input `{1, 11, -1, -11, -12}` is equal to the expected output `{-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}`.

**potential issues:**

- **bubble sort efficiency:** bubble sort is known for its inefficiency, especially for larger input sizes.

- **`issame` function:** the code relies on a function `issame` which is not defined. we assume it compares two vectors for equality.

**pass/fail result**

assuming the `issame` function correctly compares vectors, the assertion should **pass**. the code correctly calculates the digit sums and sorts the vector based on those sums, maintaining the original order for numbers with the same digit sum.

**code analysis:**

the `order_by_points` function aims to sort a vector of integers based on the sum of their digits. here's a breakdown:

1. **digit sum calculation:**
   - it iterates through each integer in the input vector `nums`.
   - for each integer:
     - it converts the absolute value of the integer to a string (`w`).
     - it calculates the sum of the digits by iterating through the string representation.

2. **sorting:**
   - it uses a bubble sort algorithm to sort the `nums` vector based on the calculated digit sums stored in the `sumdigit` vector.

**assertion analysis:**

the assertion `issame(order_by_points({1234,423,463,145,2,423,423,53,6,37,3457,3,56,0,46}) , {0, 2, 3, 6, 53, 423, 423, 423, 1234, 145, 37, 46, 56, 463, 3457})` checks if the output of the `order_by_points` function for the given input vector matches the expected output vector.

**potential issues:**

- **bubble sort efficiency:** bubble sort is known for its inefficiency, especially for larger input sizes.

- **handling negative numbers:** the code handles negative numbers by subtracting the first digit's value. this might not be the intended behavior for all cases.

- **`issame` function:** the assertion relies on a function `issame` which is not defined in the provided code. we assume it compares two vectors for equality.

**testing the assertion:**

without the `issame` function definition, we can't definitively say whether the assertion passes or fails. however, we can manually compare the output of `order_by_points` for the given input with the expected output.

**manual comparison:**

you would need to run the code, provide the input vector `{1234,423,463,145,2,423,423,53,6,37,3457,3,56,0,46}`, and compare the resulting sorted vector with the expected output `{0, 2, 3, 6, 53, 423, 423, 423, 1234, 145, 37, 46, 56, 463, 3457}`.

### final result

"assert (issame(order_by_points({}) , {}));",pass,"let's break down the code and analyze the assertion.

**code analysis**

the `order_by_points` function aims to sort a vector of integers based on the sum of their digits. here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **initialization:**
   - it creates an empty vector `sumdigit` to store the sum of digits for each number in the input vector `nums`.

2. **digit sum calculation:**
   - it iterates through each integer in `nums`.
   - for each integer:
     - it converts the absolute value of the integer to a string (`w`).
     - it calculates the sum of digits by iterating through the string representation of the number.
     - it adjusts the sum based on the sign of the original integer (adding for positive, subtracting for negative).
     - the calculated sum is stored in the `sumdigit` vector.

3. **sorting:**
   - it uses a bubble sort algorithm to sort both `nums` and `sumdigit` vectors simultaneously.
   - the sorting is based on the values in `sumdigit`. if two numbers have the same digit sum, their original order in `nums` is preserved.

**assertion analysis**

the assertion `assert (issame(order_by_points({}) , {}));` checks if calling `order_by_points` on an empty vector results in an empty vector.

- **input:** an empty vector `{}`.
- **expected output:** an empty vector `{}`.

since the function doesn't perform any operations on an empty input vector, it will return an empty vector.

**therefore, the assertion will pass.**

2. **sorting:**

**assertion analysis:**

**potential issues:**

- **bubble sort efficiency:** bubble sort is known for its inefficiency, especially for larger input sizes.

- **handling of equal sums:** the code doesn't explicitly handle cases where multiple numbers have the same digit sum. it relies on the original order in the input vector for tie-breaking.

- **`issame` function:** the assertion uses a custom function `issame`. we need to assume this function correctly compares vectors for equality.

**expected result:**

based on the code's logic, the assertion should **pass**. the code calculates the digit sums correctly and attempts to sort the vector accordingly.

**potential issues**

- **bubble sort efficiency:** bubble sort is a simple but inefficient sorting algorithm, especially for larger input sizes.

- **handling of negative numbers:** the code attempts to handle negative numbers by subtracting the first digit if it's negative. however, this might not be the most robust approach.

- **missing `issame` function:** the assertion uses a function `issame` which is not defined in the provided code.

**expected result**

given the logic of the code and the assertion, the assertion is likely to **fail**. the bubble sort implementation might not produce the exact ordering specified in the assertion due to its simplicity.

"assert (issame(order_by_points({0,6,6,-76,-21,23,4}) , {-76, -21, 0, 4, 23, 6, 6}));",fail,"let's break down the code and analyze the assertion.

**code analysis:**

1. **`order_by_points` function:**
   - the function aims to sort a vector of integers (`nums`) based on the sum of their digits.
   - it calculates the sum of digits for each number, considering the sign (positive or negative).
   - it then uses a bubble sort algorithm to sort the `nums` vector based on the calculated digit sums. if digit sums are equal, it maintains the original order.

2. **assertion:**
   - the assertion `issame(order_by_points({0,6,6,-76,-21,23,4}) , {-76, -21, 0, 4, 23, 6, 6})` checks if the output of the `order_by_points` function for the input vector `{0, 6, 6, -76, -21, 23, 4}` is equal to the expected vector `{-76, -21, 0, 4, 23, 6, 6}`.

**potential issues:**

- **bubble sort efficiency:** bubble sort is known to be inefficient for larger datasets.

- **digit sum calculation:** the code assumes that the input integers are within a range where `w[j] - 48` correctly represents the digit value. this might not be true for very large numbers.

- **`issame` function:** the code relies on an external `issame` function, which is not defined. we'll assume it compares vectors for equality.

**analyzing the assertion:**

let's manually calculate the digit sums for the input vector:

- 0: 0
- 6: 6
- 6: 6
- -76: -13
- -21: -3
- 23: 5
- 4: 4

based on these sums, the expected sorted order should be:

{-76, -21, 0, 4, 6, 6, 23}

**the assertion will fail because the expected output is incorrect.**

### final result
