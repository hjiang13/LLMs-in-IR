assert (sum_to_n(1) == 1);,pass,"let's break down the code and the assertion:

**code analysis:**

* **function `sum_to_n(int n)`:** this function calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to `n` using the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`. this is a well-known mathematical formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

* **example usage:** the comments provide examples of how the function works for different input values of `n`.

**assertion analysis:**

* **`assert (sum_to_n(1) == 1);`:** this assertion checks if the function `sum_to_n` returns the correct value (1) when the input `n` is 1.

**reasoning:**

if we plug `n = 1` into the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`, we get:

1 * (1 + 1) / 2 = 1 * 2 / 2 = 1

this matches the expected output of 1.

### final result

* **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (sum_to_n(6) == 21);,pass,"let's break down the code and the assertion:

**code analysis:**

* **function `sum_to_n(int n)`:** this function calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to `n` using the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`. this is a well-known mathematical formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

**assertion analysis:**

* **`assert(sum_to_n(6) == 21);`:** this assertion checks if the result of calling `sum_to_n(6)` is equal to 21.

**calculation:**

* `sum_to_n(6)` would calculate 6 * (6 + 1) / 2 = 21

**conclusion:**

since the calculated result (21) matches the expected value in the assertion, the assertion will pass.

**assertion analysis:**

* **`assert(sum_to_n(11) == 66);`:** this assertion checks if the result of `sum_to_n(11)` is equal to 66.

**calculation:**

let's plug `n = 11` into the formula:

 `11 * (11 + 1) / 2 = 11 * 12 / 2 = 66`

**conclusion:**

the calculation matches the expected result of the assertion.

assert (sum_to_n(30) == 465);,pass,"let's break down the code and the assertion:

**code analysis:**

the `sum_to_n` function calculates the sum of all natural numbers from 1 to `n` using the formula:

*  n * (n + 1) / 2

this is a well-known mathematical formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

**assertion analysis:**

the assertion `assert(sum_to_n(30) == 465);` checks if the result of calling `sum_to_n` with the argument 30 is equal to 465.

* we know the formula works correctly for calculating sums of consecutive numbers.
* plugging in `n = 30` into the formula: 30 * (30 + 1) / 2 = 30 * 31 / 2 = 465

**conclusion:**

since the calculated result matches the expected value in the assertion, the assertion will pass.

assert (sum_to_n(100) == 5050);,pass,"let's break down the code and the assertion:

**code analysis:**

the `sum_to_n` function calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to a given number `n` using the formula:

*  `n * (n + 1) / 2`

this is a well-known mathematical formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

**assertion analysis:**

the assertion `assert (sum_to_n(100) == 5050);` checks if the result of calling `sum_to_n` with the argument `100` is equal to `5050`.

**reasoning:**

using the formula, `sum_to_n(100)` should indeed calculate:

* 100 * (100 + 1) / 2 = 100 * 101 / 2 = 5050

**final result:**

* **assertion result**: **pass**"
