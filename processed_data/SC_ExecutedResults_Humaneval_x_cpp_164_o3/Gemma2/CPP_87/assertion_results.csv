assert (issame(get_row({,unknown,"let's break down the code and the assertion to determine if the assertion will pass or fail.

**code analysis:**

the `get_row` function is designed to find all occurrences of a given integer `x` within a 2d vector (`lst`) representing a jagged matrix (rows can have different lengths). here's how it works:

1. **initialization:** it creates an empty 2d vector `out` to store the coordinates (row, column) of found occurrences.
2. **iteration:** it iterates through each row (`i`) of the input vector `lst`.
3. **reverse column iteration:** for each row, it iterates through the columns (`j`) in *reverse order* (from the last column to the first).
4. **comparison:** it checks if the element at `lst[i][j]` is equal to the target value `x`. if it is, it adds the coordinates `{i, j}` to the `out` vector.
5. **return:** finally, it returns the `out` vector containing the coordinates of all found occurrences.

**assertion analysis:**

the provided assertion is incomplete. it starts with `assert (issame(get_row({` but doesn't provide the complete input vector or the expected output.  

**to determine if the assertion would pass or fail, we need the following:**

1. **complete input:** the full contents of the 2d vector passed to `get_row`.
2. **expected output:** the expected result (the `out` vector) that the assertion is comparing against.
3. **`issame` function:** the definition of the `issame` function, which presumably compares two vectors for equality.

**example:**

let's assume the assertion was:

```c++
assert (issame(get_row({{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}}, 5), {{1, 1}})); 
```

in this case, the assertion would **pass** because the `get_row` function would correctly return `{{1, 1}}` (the coordinates of the value 5 in the input vector).

**### final result**

- **assertion result**: **cannot be determined** (incomplete assertion) 


let me know if you can provide the missing parts of the assertion, and i'll gladly help you analyze the result!"
assert (issame(get_row({,unknown,"let's break down the code and analyze the assertion.

**code analysis**

the function `get_row` aims to find all occurrences of a given integer `x` within a 2d vector (representing a matrix with potentially varying column lengths). it then returns a vector of vectors, where each inner vector represents the row and column indices of a found occurrence.

here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **initialization:**
   - `vector<vector<int>> out={};`: an empty 2d vector `out` is created to store the coordinates of the found occurrences.

2. **iteration:**
   - the code uses nested loops to iterate through the input 2d vector `lst`.
     - the outer loop (`for (int i=0;i<lst.size();i++)`) iterates through each row of `lst`.
     - the inner loop (`for (int j=lst[i].size()-1;j>=0;j-=1)`) iterates through each element in the current row in reverse order (from the last column to the first).

3. **finding occurrences:**
   - `if (lst[i][j]==x)`: inside the loops, it checks if the current element `lst[i][j]` is equal to the target value `x`.

4. **storing coordinates:**
   - if a match is found, `out.push_back({i,j});` adds a new vector `{i, j}` to the `out` vector. this vector represents the row index (`i`) and column index (`j`) of the found occurrence.

5. **return:**
   - finally, the function returns the `out` vector containing the coordinates of all found occurrences.

**assertion analysis**

the provided assertion is incomplete. it starts with `assert (issame(get_row({` but doesn't provide the complete input for the `get_row` function or the expected output for comparison.

**to determine if the assertion passes or fails, we need the following:**

1. **complete input:** the full content of the 2d vector passed to `get_row`.
2. **expected output:** the expected result (a vector of vectors) that the assertion is comparing against.
3. **`issame` function:** the definition of the `issame` function, which presumably compares two vectors for equality.

**without this information, we cannot evaluate the assertion.**

### final result

- **assertion result**: cannot be determined."
assert (issame(get_row({,unknown,"let's break down the code and analyze the assertion.

**code analysis**

the `get_row` function aims to find all occurrences of a given integer `x` within a 2d vector (representing a matrix-like structure with potentially varying column lengths). here's how it works:

1. **initialization:**
   - it creates an empty 2d vector called `out` to store the coordinates (row, column) of found occurrences.

2. **nested loops:**
   - the outer loop iterates through each row (`i`) of the input vector `lst`.
   - the inner loop iterates through each element (`j`) within a row in *reverse order* (from the last column to the first).

3. **comparison and storage:**
   - inside the loops, it checks if the current element `lst[i][j]` is equal to the target value `x`.
   - if a match is found, it creates a new vector `{i, j}` representing the row and column indices and pushes it into the `out` vector.

4. **return:**
   - finally, the function returns the `out` vector containing the coordinates of all found occurrences of `x`.

**assertion analysis**

you've provided the beginning of an assertion:

```c++
assert (issame(get_row({
```

however, the assertion is incomplete. to properly analyze it, we need the following:

* **the complete input to `get_row`:** the 2d vector that will be searched.
* **the expected output:** what the `issame` function is comparing the result of `get_row` against.

**example assertion and analysis**

let's assume the complete assertion looks like this:

```c++
assert (issame(get_row({{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}}, 5), {{1, 1}})); 
```

in this example:

- **input to `get_row`:** `{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}}`
- **target value `x`:** 5
- **expected output:** `{{1, 1}}` (meaning the value 5 is found at row 1, column 1)

**assuming `issame` checks for equality between two vectors, this assertion would pass because the `get_row` function would correctly return `{{1, 1}}` for the given input and target value.**

**important notes:**

- without the complete assertion, we cannot definitively say whether it will pass or fail.
- the `issame` function is not defined in the provided code, so we assume it performs a vector comparison.

### final result

- **assertion result**: cannot be determined without the complete assertion."
"assert (issame(get_row({}, 1) , {}));",pass,"let's break down the code and the assertion.

**code analysis**

the `get_row` function aims to find all occurrences of a given integer `x` within a 2d vector (`lst`) and return their coordinates (row, column) in a specific format.

1. **initialization:** it creates an empty vector of vectors called `out` to store the coordinates.

2. **nested loops:** it uses nested loops to iterate through the 2d vector:
   - the outer loop (`i`) iterates through each row of the `lst`.
   - the inner loop (`j`) iterates through each element in a row *in reverse order* (from the last element to the first).

3. **finding matches:** inside the loops, it checks if the current element `lst[i][j]` is equal to the target value `x`. if it is, it creates a new vector `{i, j}` representing the row and column indices and pushes it into the `out` vector.

4. **return:** finally, it returns the `out` vector containing all the found coordinates.

**assertion analysis**

the assertion `assert (issame(get_row({}, 1) , {}));` is testing the behavior of the `get_row` function when given an empty 2d vector (`{}`) and the target value `1`.

- **empty input:** the input 2d vector is empty, meaning it has no rows or columns.

- **expected output:** the assertion expects the function to return an empty vector of vectors (`{}`) because there are no elements to search within an empty input.

**will the assertion pass?**

yes, the assertion will **pass**. the code correctly handles the case of an empty input vector. since there are no elements to find, the `get_row` function will return an empty vector, satisfying the assertion's condition.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"

5. **return:** finally, the function returns the `out` vector containing the coordinates of all occurrences of `x`.

**assertion analysis**

the assertion `assert (issame(get_row({{1}}, 2) , {}));` is designed to test if the `get_row` function correctly handles cases where the target value `x` is not present in the input vector.

- `get_row({{1}}, 2)`: this part calls the `get_row` function with a 2d vector containing only a single element (1) and searches for the value 2. since 2 is not present, the function should return an empty 2d vector.
- `{}`: this represents an empty 2d vector, which is the expected result in this case.
- `issame(...)`: this is assumed to be a custom function (not provided in the code) that compares two 2d vectors for equality.

**conclusion**

since the `get_row` function correctly returns an empty 2d vector when the target value is not found, the assertion will **pass**.

**assertion analysis**

the assertion `assert (issame(get_row({{}, {1}, {1, 2, 3}}, 3) , {{2, 2}}));` is testing the following:

- **input:** the input to the `get_row` function is a 2d vector `{{}, {1}, {1, 2, 3}}` and the target value is `3`.
- **expected output:** the assertion expects the `get_row` function to return a 2d vector containing a single coordinate: `{{2, 2}}`. this means it expects to find the value `3` at row index 2 and column index 2 of the input vector.

**evaluation**

let's examine if the code produces the expected output:

1. the input vector `{{}, {1}, {1, 2, 3}}` has three rows.
2. the value `3` is indeed present at row index 2 and column index 2.

therefore, the `get_row` function will correctly return `{{2, 2}}`, which matches the expected output of the assertion.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
