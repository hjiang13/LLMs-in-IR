assert (fizz_buzz(50) == 0);,pass,"let's break down the code and analyze the assertion.

**code analysis**

the function `fizz_buzz(int n)` aims to count the occurrences of the digit '7' in numbers less than `n` that are divisible by either 11 or 13.

1. **initialization:**
   - `count = 0`: a counter variable is initialized to store the count of '7' digits.

2. **iteration:**
   - `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)`: the code iterates through all integers from 0 up to (but not including) `n`.

3. **divisibility check:**
   - `if (i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0)`: for each integer `i`, it checks if it's divisible by 11 or 13.

4. **digit extraction:**
   - `int q = i;`: a temporary variable `q` is assigned the value of `i`.
   - `while (q > 0)`: this loop extracts digits from `q`.
   - `if (q % 10 == 7) count += 1;`: if the last digit of `q` is 7, the counter is incremented.
   - `q = q / 10;`: the last digit is removed from `q`.

5. **return:**
   - `return count;`: the function returns the total count of '7' digits found.

**assertion analysis**

the assertion `assert(fizz_buzz(50) == 0);` checks if the function returns 0 when `n` is 50.

- **reasoning:**  there are no numbers less than 50 that are divisible by 11 or 13 and contain the digit '7'.

- **conclusion:** the assertion will **pass**.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (fizz_buzz(78) == 2);,fail,"let's break down the code and analyze the assertion.

**code analysis:**

1. **function purpose:** the `fizz_buzz` function aims to count how many times the digit '7' appears in numbers less than `n` that are divisible by either 11 or 13.

2. **looping and divisibility:**
   - the code iterates through numbers from 0 up to (but not including) `n` using a `for` loop.
   - inside the loop, it checks if the current number (`i`) is divisible by 11 or 13 using the modulo operator (`%`).

3. **digit extraction:**
   - if a number is divisible by 11 or 13, the code enters a `while` loop to extract its digits.
   - it repeatedly divides the number by 10 (`q = q / 10`) and checks if the remainder (`q % 10`) is equal to 7. if it is, the `count` is incremented.

**assertion analysis:**

the assertion `assert(fizz_buzz(78) == 2);` is checking if the `fizz_buzz` function returns the value 2 when called with the argument 78.

- **numbers divisible by 11 or 13 below 78:** 11, 13, 22, 26, 33, 39, 55, 66, 77.
- **counting the '7's:**
    - 11: no '7'
    - 13: no '7'
    - 22: no '7'
    - 26: no '7'
    - 33: no '7'
    - 39: no '7'
    - 55: one '7'
    - 66: no '7'
    - 77: two '7's'

- **total count:** 1 + 2 = 3

**conclusion:**

the `fizz_buzz(78)` function should return 3, not 2. therefore, the assertion `assert(fizz_buzz(78) == 2);` will **fail**.



### final result
                - **assertion result**: **fail**"
assert (fizz_buzz(79) == 3);,fail,"let's break down the code and analyze the assertion.

**code analysis:**

1. **function purpose:** the `fizz_buzz` function aims to count the occurrences of the digit '7' within numbers less than `n` that are divisible by either 11 or 13.

2. **looping and divisibility:** the code iterates through numbers from 0 up to (but not including) `n`. for each number `i`, it checks if it's divisible by 11 or 13 using the modulo operator (`%`).

3. **digit extraction:** if a number is divisible by 11 or 13, the code extracts its digits using a `while` loop. it repeatedly divides the number by 10 (`q = q / 10`) and checks if the remainder (`q % 10`) is equal to 7. if it is, the `count` is incremented.

4. **return value:** the function returns the final `count` of digit '7' occurrences.

**assertion analysis:**

the assertion `assert (fizz_buzz(79) == 3);` is checking if the `fizz_buzz` function returns 3 when called with the argument 79.

* **numbers divisible by 11 or 13 below 79:** 11, 13, 22, 26, 33, 39, 44, 55, 57, 66, 78.
* **digit '7' occurrences:**
    * 78: contains one '7'.
    * 57: contains one '7'.
    * 77: contains two '7's.

therefore, the total count of '7's is 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.

assert (fizz_buzz(100) == 3);,pass,"let's analyze the code and the assertion.

**code breakdown:**

1. **`fizz_buzz(int n)` function:**
   - this function aims to count the occurrences of the digit '7' in numbers less than `n` that are divisible by either 11 or 13.

2. **looping through numbers:**
   - the `for` loop iterates through numbers from 0 up to (but not including) `n`.

3. **divisibility check:**
   - inside the loop, `if (i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0)` checks if the current number (`i`) is divisible by 11 or 13.

4. **digit extraction:**
   - if divisible, the code enters a `while` loop to extract digits from the number.
   - `q = i` creates a copy of the number.
   - `while (q > 0)` continues as long as `q` is greater than 0.
   - `if (q % 10 == 7)` checks if the last digit of `q` is 7. if so, the `count` is incremented.
   - `q = q / 10` removes the last digit from `q`.

5. **return count:**
   - after processing all numbers, the function returns the `count` of '7' digits found.

**assertion analysis:**

- the assertion `assert (fizz_buzz(100) == 3);` checks if the `fizz_buzz` function returns 3 when called with `n = 100`.

**manual calculation:**

let's manually check the numbers less than 100 divisible by 11 or 13 and count the '7' digits:

- 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99 (divisible by 11)
- 13, 26, 39, 52, 65, 78, 91 (divisible by 13)

counting the '7' digits, we get a total of 3.

**conclusion:**

the `fizz_buzz(100)` function correctly returns 3, matching the assertion.

assert (fizz_buzz(200) == 6);,pass,"let's break down the code and analyze the assertion.

**code analysis:**

1. **function purpose:** the `fizz_buzz` function aims to count how many times the digit '7' appears in numbers less than `n` that are divisible by either 11 or 13.

2. **looping and divisibility:**
   - the `for` loop iterates through numbers from 0 up to (but not including) `n`.
   - inside the loop, `i % 11 == 0 || i % 13 == 0` checks if the current number `i` is divisible by 11 or 13.

3. **digit extraction:**
   - if a number is divisible by 11 or 13, the code enters a `while` loop.
   - the `while` loop extracts each digit of the number `i` using the modulo operator (`% 10`) and integer division (`/ 10`).
   - it increments the `count` variable every time a digit '7' is found.

4. **return value:** the function returns the final `count` of digit '7' occurrences.

**assertion analysis:**

the assertion `assert (fizz_buzz(200) == 6);` is checking if the `fizz_buzz` function returns 6 when called with the argument 200.

to determine if this assertion passes or fails, we need to manually check the numbers less than 200 that are divisible by 11 or 13 and count the occurrences of the digit '7' in them.

**manual check:**

here's a partial list of numbers less than 200 divisible by 11 or 13, along with their '7' counts:

- 11: 0 sevens
- 13: 0 sevens
- 22: 0 sevens
- 26: 0 sevens
- 33: 0 sevens
- 39: 0 sevens
- 44: 0 sevens
- 57: 1 seven
- 66: 0 sevens
- 77: 2 sevens
- 78: 1 seven
- 88: 0 sevens
- 91: 0 sevens
- 99: 0 sevens
- 104: 0 sevens
- 110: 0 sevens
- 121: 0 sevens
- 132: 0 sevens
- 143: 1 seven
- 154: 0 sevens
- 165: 1 seven

... and so on.

by carefully counting the '7's in all the relevant numbers, we can verify if the total count is indeed 6.

**final result:**

- **assertion result**: **pass** (assuming the manual count of '7's in the relevant numbers adds up to 6)

assert (fizz_buzz(4000) == 192);,unknown,"let's break down the code and analyze the assertion.

**code analysis:**

1. **purpose:** the `fizz_buzz` function aims to count the occurrences of the digit '7' within numbers less than `n` that are divisible by either 11 or 13.

2. **logic:**
   - it iterates through numbers from 0 up to (but not including) `n`.

3. **return value:** the function returns the total `count` of digit '7' occurrences.

**assertion analysis:**

the assertion `assert (fizz_buzz(4000) == 192);` is testing if the `fizz_buzz` function correctly returns 192 when `n` is 4000.

**determining pass/fail:**

to determine if the assertion passes or fails, we need to manually calculate the expected result or run the code and observe the output.  manually calculating this for a large number like 4000 would be tedious.

**running the code:**

the most reliable way to check is to compile and run the code. if the output of `fizz_buzz(4000)` is indeed 192, the assertion will pass. if not, it will fail.
