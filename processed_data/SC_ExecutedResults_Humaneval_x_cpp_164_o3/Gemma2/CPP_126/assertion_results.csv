assert (is_sorted({5}) == true);,pass,"let's break down the code and the assertion.

**code analysis:**

the `is_sorted` function aims to determine if a given vector of integers is sorted in ascending order and doesn't contain more than one consecutive duplicate.

1. **iteration:** the code iterates through the vector starting from the second element (`i = 1`).

2. **ascending order check:** inside the loop, it compares the current element (`lst[i]`) with the previous element (`lst[i-1]`). if the current element is smaller, it means the list is not sorted in ascending order, and the function immediately returns `false`.

3. **duplicate check:** the code also checks for more than one consecutive duplicate. if the current element is equal to both the previous element (`lst[i-1]`) and the element before the previous one (`lst[i-2]`), it indicates more than one duplicate, and the function returns `false`.

4. **sorted and no duplicates:** if the loop completes without returning `false`, it means the list is sorted in ascending order and doesn't have more than one consecutive duplicate. the function returns `true`.

**assertion analysis:**

the assertion `assert (is_sorted({5}) == true);` checks if the `is_sorted` function returns `true` when given a vector containing only the element `5`.

* **input:** `{5}` (a vector with a single element)
* **expected output:** `true` (since a single element is considered sorted)

**thinking process:**

the input vector `{5}` is indeed sorted in ascending order (it's the only element), and there are no duplicates. therefore, the `is_sorted` function should return `true` for this input.

**code analysis**

the `is_sorted` function aims to determine if a given vector of integers is sorted in ascending order and doesn't contain more than one consecutive duplicate. here's how it works:

1. **iteration:** it iterates through the vector starting from the second element (`i = 1`).

2. **ascending order check:** for each element `lst[i]`, it compares it with the previous element `lst[i-1]`. if `lst[i]` is less than `lst[i-1]`, the vector is not sorted in ascending order, and the function immediately returns `false`.

3. **duplicate check:** it also checks for more than one consecutive duplicate. if the current element `lst[i]` is equal to both the previous element `lst[i-1]` and the element before that `lst[i-2]`, it means there are more than two consecutive duplicates, and the function returns `false`.

4. **sorted and no duplicates:** if the loop completes without returning `false`, it means the vector is sorted in ascending order and doesn't have more than one consecutive duplicate. the function returns `true`.

**code analysis:**

1. **function purpose:** the `is_sorted` function aims to determine if a given vector of integers is sorted in ascending order and doesn't contain more than one consecutive duplicate of any number.

2. **logic:**
   - it iterates through the vector starting from the second element (`i = 1`).
   - **ascending order check:** for each element, it compares it with the preceding element (`lst[i] < lst[i-1]`). if the current element is smaller, the vector is not sorted in ascending order, and the function immediately returns `false`.
   - **duplicate check:** it also checks for three consecutive identical elements (`lst[i] == lst[i-1] and lst[i] == lst[i-2]`). if found, it means there are more than one duplicate, and the function returns `false`.

3. **return value:** if the loop completes without finding any violations, the function returns `true`, indicating the vector is sorted in ascending order with at most one duplicate of each number.

**assertion analysis:**

the assertion `assert (is_sorted({1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}) == false);` tests if the function correctly identifies the vector `{1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}` as not sorted.

- the vector is not sorted in ascending order because `3` appears before `2`.
