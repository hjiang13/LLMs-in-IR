assert (truncate_number(3.5) == 0.5);,pass,"let's break down the code and the assertion:

**code analysis**

the `truncate_number` function aims to extract the decimal part of a floating-point number. here's how it works:

1. **`int(number)`:** this part casts the input `number` to an integer. this effectively truncates the decimal portion, keeping only the whole number part.

2. **`number - int(number)`:** this subtracts the integer part (obtained in the previous step) from the original number. the result of this subtraction is the decimal part.

**assertion analysis**

the assertion `assert(truncate_number(3.5) == 0.5);` checks if calling `truncate_number` with the argument `3.5` returns the value `0.5`.

* **`truncate_number(3.5)`:**  when we pass `3.5` to the function, `int(3.5)` will evaluate to `3`. subtracting `3` from `3.5` gives us `0.5`.

* **comparison:** the result of `truncate_number(3.5)` is indeed `0.5`, which matches the expected value in the assertion.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (abs(truncate_number(1.33) - 0.33) < 1e-4);,pass,"let's break down the code and the assertion:

**code analysis:**

* **`truncate_number(float number)`:** this function takes a floating-point number as input.
* **`return number - int(number);`:** this line calculates the decimal part. it subtracts the integer part of the number (obtained using `int(number)`, which truncates the decimal portion) from the original number.

**assertion analysis:**

* **`abs(truncate_number(1.33) - 0.33) < 1e-4`:** this assertion checks if the absolute difference between the decimal part of 1.33 (calculated by the `truncate_number` function) and 0.33 is less than a very small value (1e-4, which is 0.0001).

**reasoning:**

1. **`truncate_number(1.33)`:** when we call the function with 1.33, it will return 0.33 (1.33 - 1).
2. **`abs(0.33 - 0.33)`:** the absolute difference between 0.33 and 0.33 is 0.
3. **`0 < 1e-4`:**  0 is indeed less than 0.0001.

**final result:**

* **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (abs(truncate_number(123.456) - 0.456) < 1e-4);,pass,"let's break down the code and the assertion:

**code analysis:**

* **`truncate_number(float number)`:** this function takes a floating-point number as input.
* **`return number - int(number);`:** this line is the core logic. it subtracts the integer part of the input number from the original number.  
    * `int(number)` casts the floating-point number to an integer, effectively truncating the decimal portion.
    * the subtraction then isolates the decimal part.

**assertion analysis:**

* **`assert (abs(truncate_number(123.456) - 0.456) < 1e-4);`:** this assertion checks if the absolute difference between the result of `truncate_number(123.456)` and the expected decimal part (0.456) is less than a very small value (1e-4, which is 0.0001).

**reasoning:**

1. **`truncate_number(123.456)`:** when we call the function with 123.456, it will return 0.456 (123.456 - 123).

2. **`abs(truncate_number(123.456) - 0.456)`:** the absolute difference between the function's result (0.456) and the expected value (0.456) is 0.

3. **`0 < 1e-4`:**  since 0 is less than 0.0001, the assertion condition is true.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
