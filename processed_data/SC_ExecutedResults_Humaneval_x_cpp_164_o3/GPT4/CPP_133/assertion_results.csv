"assert (sum_squares({1,2,3})==14);",pass,"to analyze whether the provided assertion passes or fails, we need to evaluate the function `sum_squares` with the input `{1, 2, 3}` and check if the output matches the expected value of `14`.

### step-by-step analysis

1. **understanding the function**:
   - the function `sum_squares` takes a vector of floats as input.
   - it initializes a variable `sum` to `0`.
   - it iterates through each element in the vector, applies the `ceil` function to round each element to the nearest upper integer, squares it, and adds it to `sum`.
   - finally, it returns the computed `sum`.

2. **input for the assertion**:
   - the assertion is checking the output of `sum_squares({1, 2, 3})`.

3. **calculating the expected output**:
   - for the input vector `{1, 2, 3}`:
     - `ceil(1)` = 1, so `1^2` = 1
     - `ceil(2)` = 2, so `2^2` = 4
     - `ceil(3)` = 3, so `3^2` = 9
   - now, we sum these squared values:
     - `1 + 4 + 9 = 14`

4. **comparing the output to the expected value**:
   - the function should return `14` for the input `{1, 2, 3}`.
   - the assertion checks if `sum_squares({1, 2, 3}) == 14`, which we have calculated to be true.

### conclusion
since the output of the function matches the expected value, the assertion will pass.
