assert (is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == false);,pass,"to analyze the provided c/c++ code and the assertion statement, let's break down the function `is_equal_to_sum_even` and the assertion itself.

### function analysis
the function `is_equal_to_sum_even` takes an integer `n` as input and evaluates whether `n` can be expressed as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. 

1. **condition check**:
   - the function first checks if `n` is even (`n % 2 == 0`) and if `n` is greater than or equal to 8 (`n >= 8`).
   - if both conditions are true, the function returns `true`.
   - if either condition is false, it returns `false`.

2. **understanding even numbers**:
   - the smallest positive even number is 2. therefore, the smallest sum of 4 positive even numbers is `2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8`.
   - this means that any even number less than 8 cannot be expressed as the sum of 4 positive even numbers.

### assertion statement
the assertion statement is:
```cpp
assert (is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == false);
```
this statement checks if the function returns `false` when `n` is 4.

### evaluation of the assertion
1. **input**: `n = 4`
2. **condition evaluation**:
   - check if `4 % 2 == 0`: this is `true` since 4 is even.
   - check if `4 >= 8`: this is `false` since 4 is less than 8.
3. **function return**:
   - since one of the conditions is false (`4 >= 8`), the function will return `false`.

### conclusion
the assertion checks if the function returns `false` for the input `4`, which it does. therefore, the assertion passes.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == false);,pass,"to analyze whether the assertion passes or fails, we need to evaluate the function `is_equal_to_sum_even` with the input provided in the assertion.

### step-by-step analysis

1. **understanding the function**:
   - the function `is_equal_to_sum_even(int n)` checks if the integer `n` can be expressed as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.
   - the function has a condition: 
     - it returns `true` if `n` is even (`n % 2 == 0`) and `n` is greater than or equal to 8 (`n >= 8`).
     - otherwise, it returns `false`.

2. **evaluating the assertion**:
   - the assertion we need to evaluate is:
     ```cpp
     assert (is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == false);
     ```
   - we will call the function with `n = 6` and check the return value.

3. **calling the function**:
   - when we call `is_equal_to_sum_even(6)`:
     - first, we check if `6` is even: `6 % 2 == 0` evaluates to `true`.
     - next, we check if `6` is greater than or equal to `8`: `6 >= 8` evaluates to `false`.
   - since one of the conditions is false, the function will return `false`.

4. **evaluating the assertion**:
   - the assertion checks if `is_equal_to_sum_even(6)` is equal to `false`.
   - since the function returns `false`, the assertion evaluates to `true`.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == true);,pass,"to analyze the provided c/c++ code and the assertion statement, we need to evaluate the function `is_equal_to_sum_even(int n)` and determine if it behaves as expected for the given input.

### code analysis

1. **function purpose**: the function `is_equal_to_sum_even(int n)` is designed to check if the integer `n` can be expressed as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.

2. **logic of the function**:
   - the function first checks if `n` is even (`n % 2 == 0`) and if `n` is greater than or equal to 8 (`n >= 8`).
   - if both conditions are satisfied, it returns `true`.
   - if either condition fails, it returns `false`.

3. **understanding the conditions**:
   - **even check**: the number must be even to be expressed as a sum of even numbers.
   - **minimum value**: the smallest sum of 4 positive even numbers is 8 (which is 2 + 2 + 2 + 2). therefore, any even number less than 8 cannot be expressed as such a sum.

### assertion statement evaluation
now, we will evaluate the assertion statement:

```cpp
assert (is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == true);
```

- **input**: `n = 8`
- **evaluation**:
  - check if `8` is even: `8 % 2 == 0` → `true`
  - check if `8` is greater than or equal to 8: `8 >= 8` → `true`
- since both conditions are satisfied, the function will return `true`.

### conclusion
the assertion statement checks if the function returns `true` for the input `8`. since our analysis shows that the function will indeed return `true`, the assertion will pass.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (is_equal_to_sum_even(10) == true);,pass,"to analyze the provided c/c++ code and the assertion statement, let's break down the function `is_equal_to_sum_even` and the assertion itself.

### function analysis
the function `is_equal_to_sum_even(int n)` checks two conditions:
1. whether `n` is even (`n % 2 == 0`).
2. whether `n` is greater than or equal to 8 (`n >= 8`).

if both conditions are satisfied, the function returns `true`. otherwise, it returns `false`.

### assertion statement
the assertion statement is:
```cpp
assert (is_equal_to_sum_even(10) == true);
```

we need to evaluate `is_equal_to_sum_even(10)`:
- first, we check if `10` is even:
  - `10 % 2 == 0` → this is `true`.
- next, we check if `10` is greater than or equal to 8:
  - `10 >= 8` → this is also `true`.

since both conditions are satisfied, the function will return `true` for the input `10`.

### assertion evaluation
the assertion checks if `is_equal_to_sum_even(10)` returns `true`. since we have established that it does return `true`, the assertion will pass.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (is_equal_to_sum_even(11) == false);,pass,"to analyze whether the provided assertion passes or fails based on the given c/c++ code, we need to break down the function `is_equal_to_sum_even` and the assertion statement.

### code analysis
1. **function purpose**: the function `is_equal_to_sum_even(int n)` checks if the integer `n` can be expressed as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.
2. **logic in the function**:
   - the function first checks if `n` is even (`n % 2 == 0`) and if `n` is greater than or equal to 8 (`n >= 8`).
   - if both conditions are true, it returns `true`.
   - if either condition is false, it returns `false`.

3. **understanding the conditions**:
   - the sum of 4 positive even numbers must be at least 8 (since the smallest positive even number is 2, and 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8).
   - therefore, any even number less than 8 cannot be expressed as the sum of 4 positive even numbers.
   - odd numbers cannot be expressed as the sum of even numbers, as the sum of even numbers is always even.

### assertion statement
the assertion statement we need to evaluate is:
```cpp
assert (is_equal_to_sum_even(11) == false);
```

1. **input value**: `n = 11`
2. **evaluation**:
   - check if `n` is even: `11 % 2 == 0` evaluates to `false`.
   - since the first condition is false, the function will return `false` without needing to check the second condition.

### conclusion
the assertion checks if `is_equal_to_sum_even(11)` returns `false`, which it does based on our analysis.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (is_equal_to_sum_even(12) == true);,pass,"to analyze the provided c/c++ code and the assertion statement, let's break down the function `is_equal_to_sum_even` and the assertion itself.

### function analysis
the function `is_equal_to_sum_even` takes an integer `n` as input and checks two conditions:
1. whether `n` is even (`n % 2 == 0`).
2. whether `n` is greater than or equal to 8 (`n >= 8`).

if both conditions are satisfied, the function returns `true`. otherwise, it returns `false`.

### assertion statement
the assertion statement we need to evaluate is:
```cpp
assert (is_equal_to_sum_even(12) == true);
```

### evaluation of the assertion
1. **input value**: `n = 12`
2. **check if `n` is even**: 
   - `12 % 2 == 0` evaluates to `true` (12 is even).
3. **check if `n` is greater than or equal to 8**: 
   - `12 >= 8` evaluates to `true` (12 is indeed greater than 8).

since both conditions are satisfied, the function `is_equal_to_sum_even(12)` will return `true`.

### conclusion
the assertion checks if the result of `is_equal_to_sum_even(12)` is `true`, which it is. therefore, the assertion will pass.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (is_equal_to_sum_even(13) == false);,pass,"to analyze the assertion statement `assert (is_equal_to_sum_even(13) == false);`, we need to evaluate the function `is_equal_to_sum_even` with the input `n = 13`.

### step-by-step analysis:

1. **understanding the function**:
   - the function `is_equal_to_sum_even(int n)` checks if the number `n` can be expressed as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.
   - the function has the following logic:
     - it first checks if `n` is even (`n % 2 == 0`) and if `n` is greater than or equal to 8 (`n >= 8`).
     - if both conditions are true, it returns `true`.
     - if either condition is false, it returns `false`.

2. **evaluating the input**:
   - we are testing the function with `n = 13`.
   - first, we check if `n` is even: `13 % 2 == 0` evaluates to `false` because 13 is an odd number.
   - since the first condition is false, the function will not proceed to check the second condition (`n >= 8`).
   - as a result, the function will return `false`.

3. **evaluating the assertion**:
   - the assertion checks if `is_equal_to_sum_even(13)` returns `false`.
   - since we determined that `is_equal_to_sum_even(13)` indeed returns `false`, the assertion holds true.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (is_equal_to_sum_even(16) == true);,pass,"to analyze whether the provided assertion passes or fails, we need to understand the logic of the function `is_equal_to_sum_even(int n)` and how it relates to the assertion statement.

### function logic breakdown
1. **input parameter**: the function takes an integer `n`.
2. **condition check**:
   - the function first checks if `n` is even (`n % 2 == 0`).
   - it also checks if `n` is greater than or equal to 8 (`n >= 8`).
3. **return value**:
   - if both conditions are satisfied, the function returns `true`.
   - if either condition fails, it returns `false`.

### analyzing the assertion
the assertion we need to evaluate is:
```cpp
assert (is_equal_to_sum_even(16) == true);
```

1. **input value**: `n = 16`
2. **condition evaluation**:
   - check if `16` is even: `16 % 2 == 0` → **true** (since 16 is even).
   - check if `16` is greater than or equal to 8: `16 >= 8` → **true** (since 16 is indeed greater than 8).
3. **return value**: since both conditions are true, the function will return `true`.

### conclusion
the assertion checks if the function returns `true` for the input `16`. since the function does return `true`, the assertion will pass.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
