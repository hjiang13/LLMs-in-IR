assert (is_sorted({5}) == true);,pass,"to analyze whether the provided assertion passes or fails based on the given c/c++ code, we need to break down the function `is_sorted` and understand how it processes the input vector.

### code analysis

1. **function purpose**: the function `is_sorted` checks if a vector of integers is sorted in ascending order and ensures that there are no duplicates of the same number appearing more than once.

2. **input**: the function takes a vector of integers (`vector<int> lst`).

3. **logic**:
   - the function iterates through the vector starting from the second element (index 1).
   - it checks two conditions:
     - if the current element is less than the previous element (`lst[i] < lst[i-1]`), it returns `false`, indicating that the vector is not sorted.
     - if the current element is equal to the previous element and also equal to the one before that (`lst[i] == lst[i-1] && lst[i] == lst[i-2]`), it returns `false`, indicating that there are more than one duplicate of the same number.
   - if neither condition is met throughout the loop, it returns `true`, indicating that the vector is sorted and does not have duplicates.

### assertion statement
the assertion we need to evaluate is:
```cpp
assert (is_sorted({5}) == true);
```

### evaluation of the assertion
- the input vector is `{5}`.
- the vector has only one element.
- since there is only one element, it is trivially sorted (there are no other elements to compare it to).
- there are no duplicates since there is only one element.

### conclusion
given the logic of the `is_sorted` function, the assertion `assert (is_sorted({5}) == true);` will evaluate to `true`, meaning the assertion passes.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (is_sorted({1, 2, 3, 4, 5}) == true);",pass,"to analyze whether the provided assertion passes or fails based on the given c/c++ code, let's break down the function `is_sorted` and the assertion statement.

### function analysis

the function `is_sorted` takes a vector of integers as input and checks two conditions:

1. **ascending order check**: the function iterates through the vector starting from the second element (index 1) and checks if each element is less than the previous element. if it finds any element that is less than the one before it, it returns `false`, indicating that the vector is not sorted in ascending order.

2. **duplicate check**: the function also checks for duplicates. specifically, it checks if the current element is equal to the previous element and also equal to the one before that (i.e., it checks for three consecutive equal elements). if it finds such a case, it returns `false`, indicating that there are more than one duplicate of the same number.

### assertion statement

the assertion we are analyzing is:
```cpp
assert (is_sorted({1, 2, 3, 4, 5}) == true);
```

### step-by-step execution of `is_sorted({1, 2, 3, 4, 5})`

1. the input vector is `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`.
2. the function starts iterating from index 1:
   - **i = 1**: `lst[1] (2) >= lst[0] (1)` → continue
   - **i = 2**: `lst[2] (3) >= lst[1] (2)` → continue
   - **i = 3**: `lst[3] (4) >= lst[2] (3)` → continue
   - **i = 4**: `lst[4] (5) >= lst[3] (4)` → continue
3. the duplicate check is not triggered since there are no consecutive duplicates.
4. the loop completes without returning `false`, so the function returns `true`.

### conclusion

since the function correctly identifies that the vector `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}` is sorted in ascending order and does not contain more than one duplicate of any number, the assertion evaluates to `true`.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (is_sorted({1, 3, 2, 4, 5}) == false);",pass,"to analyze the assertion statement `assert (is_sorted({1, 3, 2, 4, 5}) == false);`, we need to evaluate the function `is_sorted` with the input vector `{1, 3, 2, 4, 5}`.

### step-by-step analysis of the function

1. **function definition**: the function `is_sorted` takes a vector of integers and checks two conditions:
   - whether the vector is sorted in ascending order.
   - whether there are more than one duplicate of the same number.

2. **loop through the vector**:
   - the loop starts from index `1` and goes to the end of the vector.
   - for each element, it checks if the current element is less than the previous element (`lst[i] < lst[i-1]`). if this condition is true, the function returns `false`, indicating that the vector is not sorted.
   - it also checks for duplicates. specifically, it checks if the current element is equal to the previous element and also equal to the one before that (`lst[i] == lst[i-1] && lst[i] == lst[i-2]`). if this condition is true, it returns `false`, indicating that there are more than one duplicate of the same number.

3. **input vector**: for the input `{1, 3, 2, 4, 5}`:
   - **iteration 1** (`i = 1`): 
     - compare `lst[1] (3)` with `lst[0] (1)`: `3 >= 1` (no return).
   - **iteration 2** (`i = 2`): 
     - compare `lst[2] (2)` with `lst[1] (3)`: `2 < 3` (this condition is true).
     - the function returns `false` immediately.

since the function returns `false` for the input vector `{1, 3, 2, 4, 5}`, we can evaluate the assertion:

### assertion evaluation
the assertion checks if `is_sorted({1, 3, 2, 4, 5})` is equal to `false`. since the function indeed returns `false`, the assertion passes.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (is_sorted({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}) == true);",pass,"to analyze the provided c++ function `is_sorted` and determine whether the assertion passes or fails, let's break down the function's logic and the assertion statement.

### function logic breakdown

1. **input**: the function takes a vector of integers (`lst`).
2. **loop through the vector**: the function iterates from the second element (index 1) to the last element of the vector.
3. **check for ascending order**:
   - the first condition checks if the current element is less than the previous element (`lst[i] < lst[i-1]`). if this condition is true, the function returns `false`, indicating that the vector is not sorted in ascending order.
4. **check for duplicates**:
   - the second condition checks if the current element is equal to the previous element and also equal to the one before that (`lst[i] == lst[i-1] && lst[i] == lst[i-2]`). if this condition is true, it means there are more than one duplicate of the same number, and the function returns `false`.
5. **return true**: if none of the conditions for returning `false` are met, the function returns `true`, indicating that the vector is sorted in ascending order without excessive duplicates.

### assertion analysis

now, let's analyze the assertion statement:

```cpp
assert (is_sorted({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}) == true);
```

1. **input vector**: the input vector is `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`.
2. **function execution**:
   - the loop starts at index 1 (value `2`):
     - compare `2` with `1`: `2 >= 1` (condition passes).
   - next, at index 2 (value `3`):
     - compare `3` with `2`: `3 >= 2` (condition passes).
   - next, at index 3 (value `4`):
     - compare `4` with `3`: `4 >= 3` (condition passes).
   - next, at index 4 (value `5`):
     - compare `5` with `4`: `5 >= 4` (condition passes).
   - finally, at index 5 (value `6`):
     - compare `6` with `5`: `6 >= 5` (condition passes).
3. **duplicate check**: the duplicate check conditions are not triggered since there are no duplicates in the vector.
4. **return value**: since all checks pass, the function returns `true`.

### conclusion

since the function correctly identifies that the vector `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}` is sorted in ascending order and does not contain excessive duplicates, the assertion evaluates to `true`.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (is_sorted({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}) == true);",pass,"to analyze whether the provided assertion passes or fails based on the given c/c++ code, we need to break down the function `is_sorted` and understand how it processes the input vector.

### function analysis
the function `is_sorted` checks if the input vector `lst` is sorted in ascending order and also ensures that there are no more than one duplicate of the same number. here’s how it works step by step:

1. **loop through the vector**: the function iterates through the vector starting from the second element (index 1).
2. **check for ascending order**: for each element, it checks if the current element is less than the previous element (`lst[i] < lst[i-1]`). if this condition is true, the function returns `false`, indicating that the vector is not sorted.
3. **check for duplicates**: the function also checks for duplicates. specifically, it checks if the current element is equal to the previous element and also equal to the element before that (`lst[i] == lst[i-1] && lst[i] == lst[i-2]`). if this condition is true, it returns `false`, indicating that there are more than one duplicate of the same number.
4. **return true**: if the loop completes without returning `false`, the function returns `true`, indicating that the vector is sorted and does not have more than one duplicate of any number.

### assertion analysis
now, let's analyze the assertion:
```cpp
assert (is_sorted({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}) == true);
```

1. **input vector**: the input vector is `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}`.
2. **sorted check**: the function will iterate through the vector:
   - for `i = 1`: `lst[1] (2) >= lst[0] (1)` (pass)
   - for `i = 2`: `lst[2] (3) >= lst[1] (2)` (pass)
   - for `i = 3`: `lst[3] (4) >= lst[2] (3)` (pass)
   - for `i = 4`: `lst[4] (5) >= lst[3] (4)` (pass)
   - for `i = 5`: `lst[5] (6) >= lst[4] (5)` (pass)
   - for `i = 6`: `lst[6] (7) >= lst[5] (6)` (pass)
3. **duplicate check**: the function checks for duplicates:
   - for `i = 2`: `lst[2] (3) != lst[1] (2)` (pass)
   - for `i = 3`: `lst[3] (4) != lst[2] (3)` (pass)
   - for `i = 4`: `lst[4] (5) != lst[3] (4)` (pass)
   - for `i = 5`: `lst[5] (6) != lst[4] (5)` (pass)
   - for `i = 6`: `lst[6] (7) != lst[5] (6)` (pass)

since the vector is sorted in ascending order and there are no duplicates, the function will return `true`.

### final result
based on the analysis, the assertion will pass.

- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (is_sorted({1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}) == false);",pass,"to analyze the assertion statement and determine whether it passes or fails, we need to closely examine the provided c++ function `is_sorted` and the specific input used in the assertion.

### breakdown of the function

1. **function purpose**: the function `is_sorted` checks if a vector of integers is sorted in ascending order and ensures that there are no duplicates of the same number (more than one occurrence).

2. **logic of the function**:
   - the function iterates through the vector starting from the second element (index 1).
   - it checks two conditions:
     - if the current element is less than the previous element (`lst[i] < lst[i-1]`), it returns `false`, indicating that the vector is not sorted.
     - if the current element is equal to the previous element and also equal to the one before that (`lst[i] == lst[i-1] && lst[i] == lst[i-2]`), it returns `false`, indicating that there are more than one duplicate of the same number.
   - if neither condition is met throughout the loop, the function returns `true`, indicating that the vector is sorted and does not have duplicates.

### analyzing the assertion

the assertion we need to evaluate is:
```cpp
assert (is_sorted({1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}) == false);
```

- **input vector**: `{1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}`
- **step-by-step execution**:
  - the function starts with `i = 1`:
    - `lst[1] (3) < lst[0] (1)` is `false`.
    - `i` is not greater than or equal to 2, so the second condition is not checked.
  - next, `i = 2`:
    - `lst[2] (2) < lst[1] (3)` is `true`. 
    - since this condition is met, the function returns `false` immediately.

### conclusion

the function correctly identifies that the vector `{1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}` is not sorted in ascending order, and thus the assertion checks if the return value is `false`, which it is.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (is_sorted({}) == true);,pass,"to analyze the provided c++ code and the assertion statement, let's break down the function `is_sorted` and the assertion itself.

### code analysis

1. **function purpose**: the function `is_sorted` checks if a given vector of integers is sorted in ascending order and ensures that there are no more than one duplicate of the same number.

2. **function logic**:
   - the function iterates through the vector starting from the second element (index 1).
   - it checks if the current element is less than the previous element (`lst[i] < lst[i-1]`). if this condition is true, the vector is not sorted, and the function returns `false`.
   - it also checks for duplicates. specifically, it checks if the current element is equal to the previous element and if it is also equal to the element before the previous one (`lst[i] == lst[i-1] && lst[i] == lst[i-2]`). if this condition is true, it indicates that there are more than one duplicate of the same number, and the function returns `false`.
   - if none of the conditions for returning `false` are met, the function returns `true`, indicating that the vector is sorted and does not have excessive duplicates.

3. **edge case**: the function does not explicitly handle the case of an empty vector. however, since the loop (`for (int i=1; i<lst.size(); i++)`) will not execute for an empty vector (as `lst.size()` is 0), the function will directly reach the return statement at the end, which returns `true`.

### assertion analysis

the assertion statement is:
```cpp
assert(is_sorted({}) == true);
```

- here, we are testing the function with an empty vector (`{}`).
- as analyzed, the function will not enter the loop and will return `true` for an empty vector.

### conclusion

since the function correctly returns `true` for an empty vector, the assertion passes.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (is_sorted({1}) == true);,pass,"to analyze whether the provided assertion passes or fails based on the given c/c++ code, let's break down the function `is_sorted` and the assertion statement step by step.

### code analysis

1. **function purpose**: the function `is_sorted` checks if a vector of integers is sorted in ascending order and ensures that there are no more than one duplicate of the same number.

2. **parameters**: the function takes a single parameter `lst`, which is a vector of integers.

3. **logic**:
   - the function iterates through the vector starting from the second element (index 1).
   - it checks two conditions:
     - if the current element is less than the previous element (`lst[i] < lst[i-1]`), it returns `false`, indicating the vector is not sorted.
     - if the current element is equal to the previous element and also equal to the one before that (`lst[i] == lst[i-1] && lst[i] == lst[i-2]`), it returns `false`, indicating there are more than one duplicate of the same number.
   - if neither condition is met throughout the loop, it returns `true`, indicating the vector is sorted and does not have excessive duplicates.

### assertion statement

the assertion statement is:
```cpp
assert (is_sorted({1}) == true);
```

- here, we are testing the function with a vector containing a single element `{1}`.

### evaluation of the assertion

1. **input**: the input vector is `{1}`.
2. **function execution**:
   - the vector has only one element, so the loop (`for (int i=1; i<lst.size(); i++)`) will not execute because `lst.size()` is 1, and `i` starts at 1.
   - since the loop does not execute, the function will reach the return statement `return true;`.
3. **expected output**: the expected output for `is_sorted({1})` is `true`.

### conclusion

since the function correctly identifies that a single-element vector is sorted and does not contain duplicates, the assertion will pass.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (is_sorted({3, 2, 1}) == false);",pass,"to analyze the provided c++ function `is_sorted` and determine whether the assertion `assert(is_sorted({3, 2, 1}) == false);` passes or fails, let's break down the function's logic and the assertion itself.

   - the second condition checks if the current element is equal to the previous element and also equal to the element before that (`lst[i] == lst[i-1] && lst[i] == lst[i-2]`). if this condition is true, it indicates that there are more than 1 duplicate of the same number, and the function returns `false`.
5. **return true**: if none of the conditions for returning `false` are met, the function returns `true`, indicating that the vector is sorted in ascending order and does not contain more than 1 duplicate of any number.

### analyzing the assertion
now, let's analyze the assertion `assert(is_sorted({3, 2, 1}) == false);`.

- the input vector is `{3, 2, 1}`.
- the function will start iterating from index 1:
  - at `i = 1`: `lst[1]` is `2` and `lst[0]` is `3`. the condition `lst[1] < lst[0]` (i.e., `2 < 3`) is true, so the function will return `false`.
- since the function returns `false`, the assertion checks if `false == false`, which is true.

### conclusion
the assertion `assert(is_sorted({3, 2, 1}) == false);` passes because the function correctly identifies that the vector is not sorted in ascending order.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (is_sorted({1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4}) == false);",pass,"to analyze whether the provided assertion passes or fails, we need to carefully examine the `is_sorted` function and the specific assertion statement.

1. **input**: the function takes a vector of integers `lst`.
2. **loop**: it iterates through the vector starting from the second element (index 1).
3. **sorting check**: 
   - it checks if the current element (`lst[i]`) is less than the previous element (`lst[i-1]`). if this condition is true, it returns `false`, indicating that the vector is not sorted in ascending order.
4. **duplicate check**:
   - it checks if the current element is equal to the previous element (`lst[i] == lst[i-1]`) and also equal to the element before the previous one (`lst[i] == lst[i-2]`). if both conditions are true, it returns `false`, indicating that there are more than 1 duplicate of the same number.
5. **return value**: if none of the conditions for returning `false` are met, it returns `true`, indicating that the vector is sorted in ascending order without excessive duplicates.

### analyzing the assertion:
the assertion we need to analyze is:
```cpp

```

- the input vector is `{1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4}`.
- the function will iterate through the vector:
  - for `i = 1`: `lst[1] (2) >= lst[0] (1)` → continue.
  - for `i = 2`: `lst[2] (2) >= lst[1] (2)` → continue.
    - now check for duplicates: `lst[2] (2) == lst[1] (2)` and `lst[2] (2) == lst[0] (1)` → false (only checks the previous two).
  - for `i = 3`: `lst[3] (2) >= lst[2] (2)` → continue.
    - now check for duplicates: `lst[3] (2) == lst[2] (2)` and `lst[3] (2) == lst[1] (2)` → true (this means there are more than 1 duplicate of the same number).
    - the function will return `false` due to this condition.

### conclusion:
the assertion checks if the function returns `false` for the input `{1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4}`, which is indeed the case based on our analysis.

### breakdown of the `is_sorted` function:

1. **initialization**: the function takes a vector of integers `lst` as input.

2. **loop through the vector**: the function uses a for loop that starts from index 1 and goes through each element of the vector.

3. **check for ascending order**:
   - the first condition checks if the current element `lst[i]` is less than the previous element `lst[i-1]`. if this condition is true, it means the vector is not sorted in ascending order, and the function returns `false`.

4. **check for duplicates**:
   - the second condition checks if the current element is equal to the previous element and also equal to the one before that (i.e., `lst[i] == lst[i-1] && lst[i] == lst[i-2]`). if this condition is true, it indicates that there are more than one duplicate of the same number, and the function returns `false`.

5. **return true**: if none of the conditions for returning `false` are met, the function returns `true`, indicating that the vector is sorted in ascending order without excessive duplicates.

### analyzing the input `{1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4}`:

- the loop will iterate through the vector as follows:
  - for `i = 1`: `lst[1]` (2) is not less than `lst[0]` (1), so continue.
  - for `i = 2`: `lst[2]` (3) is not less than `lst[1]` (2), so continue.
  - for `i = 3`: `lst[3]` (3) is equal to `lst[2]` (3) and also equal to `lst[1]` (3). this triggers the second condition, which checks for duplicates. since `3` appears three times in a row, the function will return `false`.

### conclusion:
the assertion `assert (is_sorted({1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4}) == false);` checks if the function correctly identifies that the vector is not sorted due to the presence of excessive duplicates. since the function will indeed return `false` for this input, the assertion passes.

### function analysis
the function `is_sorted` takes a vector of integers and checks two main conditions:
1. the vector must be sorted in ascending order.
2. there cannot be more than one duplicate of the same number.

#### step-by-step breakdown of the function:
1. **sorting check**: the loop iterates through the vector starting from the second element (index 1). for each element, it checks if the current element is less than the previous element (`lst[i] < lst[i-1]`). if this condition is true, the function returns `false`, indicating that the vector is not sorted.
  
2. **duplicate check**: the function also checks for duplicates. specifically, it checks if the current element is equal to the previous element and also equal to the one before that (`lst[i] == lst[i-1] && lst[i] == lst[i-2]`). if this condition is true, it returns `false`, indicating that there are more than one duplicate of the same number.

3. if neither condition is met throughout the loop, the function returns `true`, indicating that the vector is sorted and does not contain more than one duplicate of any number.

### assertion statement
the assertion we need to evaluate is:
```cpp
assert (is_sorted({1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4}) == true);
```

#### evaluating the input `{1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4}`:
- the vector is `{1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4}`.
- the function will iterate through the vector:
  - for `i = 1`: `lst[1] (2) >= lst[0] (1)` → continue.
  - for `i = 2`: `lst[2] (2) >= lst[1] (2)` → continue. now check for duplicates: `lst[2] (2) == lst[1] (2)` and `lst[2] (2) == lst[0] (1)` → this condition is false, so continue.
  - for `i = 3`: `lst[3] (3) >= lst[2] (2)` → continue.
  - for `i = 4`: `lst[4] (3) >= lst[3] (3)` → continue. now check for duplicates: `lst[4] (3) == lst[3] (3)` and `lst[4] (3) == lst[2] (2)` → this condition is false, so continue.
  - for `i = 5`: `lst[5] (4) >= lst[4] (3)` → continue.

after checking all elements, the function does not return `false` for either condition and will return `true`.

### conclusion
the assertion `assert (is_sorted({1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4}) == true);` is incorrect because the function should return `false` due to the presence of duplicates (two `2`s and two `3`s).

### function analysis
1. **input**: the function takes a vector of integers as input.
2. **loop**: it iterates through the vector starting from the second element (index 1).
3. **first condition**: the first condition checks if the current element is less than the previous element (`lst[i] < lst[i-1]`). if this condition is true, the function returns `false`, indicating that the vector is not sorted in ascending order.
4. **second condition**: the second condition checks for duplicates. specifically, it checks if the current element is equal to the previous element and also equal to the element before that (`lst[i] == lst[i-1] && lst[i] == lst[i-2]`). if this condition is true, the function returns `false`, indicating that there are more than one duplicate of the same number.
5. **return value**: if none of the conditions for returning `false` are met during the loop, the function returns `true`, indicating that the vector is sorted in ascending order without any duplicates.

### assertion analysis
now, let's analyze the assertion:

```cpp

```

1. **input vector**: the input vector is `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.
2. **iteration**:
   - for `i = 1`: 
     - `lst[1]` (2) is not less than `lst[0]` (1), so the first condition is false.
     - the second condition does not apply since `i < 2`.
   - for `i = 2`: 
     - `lst[2]` (3) is not less than `lst[1]` (2), so the first condition is false.
     - the second condition does not apply since `i < 2`.
   - for `i = 3`: 
     - `lst[3]` (4) is not less than `lst[2]` (3), so the first condition is false.
     - the second condition does not apply since `i < 2`.
3. **conclusion**: since none of the conditions for returning `false` were met during the iterations, the function will return `true`.
