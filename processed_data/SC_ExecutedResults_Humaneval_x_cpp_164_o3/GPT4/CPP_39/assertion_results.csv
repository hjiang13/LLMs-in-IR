assert (prime_fib(1) == 2);,fail,"to analyze the provided c/c++ code for the function `prime_fib`, we need to understand its logic and how it computes the n-th fibonacci number that is also prime.

### code analysis

1. **initialization**:
   - the function initializes two fibonacci numbers: `f1` (starting at 1) and `f2` (starting at 2).
   - a counter `count` is initialized to 0 to keep track of how many prime fibonacci numbers have been found.

2. **fibonacci sequence generation**:
   - the function enters a `while` loop that continues until `count` reaches `n`.
   - inside the loop, it calculates the next fibonacci number by updating `f1` and `f2`:
     - `f1` is updated to `f1 + f2` (the next fibonacci number).
     - the values of `f1` and `f2` are swapped using a temporary variable `m`.

3. **prime checking**:
   - after calculating the new fibonacci number (`f1`), the function checks if it is prime:
     - a boolean variable `isprime` is initialized to `true`.
     - a loop checks for factors of `f1` from 2 up to the square root of `f1`. if any factor is found, `isprime` is set to `false`.

4. **counting prime fibonacci numbers**:
   - if `isprime` remains `true`, the `count` is incremented.
   - if `count` equals `n`, the function returns the current fibonacci number `f1`.

### assertion analysis

now, let's analyze the assertion statement:
```cpp
assert (prime_fib(1) == 2);
```

- we need to check what `prime_fib(1)` returns.
- according to the comments in the code, `prime_fib(1)` should return 2, which is the first fibonacci number that is also prime.

### execution of `prime_fib(1)`:

1. **first iteration**:
   - initial values: `f1 = 1`, `f2 = 2`, `count = 0`.
   - calculate the next fibonacci number:
     - `f1 = f1 + f2` → `f1 = 1 + 2 = 3`
     - swap: `m = f1` → `f1 = 2`, `f2 = 3`.
   - check if `f1` (which is now 3) is prime:
     - the loop checks for factors of 3. it only checks `w = 2` (since `2*2 > 3`).
     - 3 is not divisible by 2, so `isprime` remains `true`.
   - increment `count` → `count = 1`.
   - since `count` equals `n` (1), the function returns `f1`, which is 3.

### conclusion

the assertion checks if `prime_fib(1)` returns 2, but the function actually returns 3. therefore, the assertion fails.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **fail**"
assert (prime_fib(2) == 3);,pass,"to analyze the provided c/c++ code for the function `prime_fib`, we need to understand how the function works and whether it correctly computes the n-th fibonacci number that is also prime.

### code analysis

1. **initialization**:
   - the function initializes two fibonacci numbers: `f1` (starting at 1) and `f2` (starting at 2).
   - a counter `count` is initialized to 0 to track how many prime fibonacci numbers have been found.

2. **fibonacci generation**:
   - the function enters a `while` loop that continues until `count` reaches `n`.
   - inside the loop, the next fibonacci number is computed by updating `f1` and `f2`. the new `f1` is calculated as `f1 + f2`, and then `f1` and `f2` are swapped.

3. **prime checking**:
   - for each new fibonacci number (`f1`), the function checks if it is prime.
   - a boolean variable `isprime` is initialized to `true`, and a loop checks for factors from 2 up to the square root of `f1`.
   - if any factor is found, `isprime` is set to `false`.

4. **counting prime fibonacci numbers**:
   - if `isprime` remains `true`, the counter `count` is incremented.
   - if `count` equals `n`, the function returns the current fibonacci number `f1`.

### assertion analysis
now, let's analyze the assertion `assert (prime_fib(2) == 3);`.

- we need to find the 2nd fibonacci number that is also prime.
- the fibonacci sequence starts as follows: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
- the prime numbers in the fibonacci sequence are:
  - 2 (1st prime fibonacci)
  - 3 (2nd prime fibonacci)
  - 5 (3rd prime fibonacci)
  - 13 (4th prime fibonacci)
  - 89 (5th prime fibonacci)

from the above, we can see that:
- the 1st prime fibonacci number is 2.
- the 2nd prime fibonacci number is 3.

thus, `prime_fib(2)` should return 3.

### conclusion
since the assertion checks if `prime_fib(2)` equals 3, and we have established that this is indeed the case, the assertion will pass.

3. **prime checking**:
   - for each new fibonacci number (`f1`), the function checks if it is prime.
   - it does this by checking divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `f1`. if `f1` is divisible by any of these numbers, it is marked as not prime.

4. **counting prime fibonacci numbers**:
   - if `f1` is found to be prime, the `count` is incremented.
   - if `count` equals `n`, the function returns the current fibonacci number `f1`.

### assertions

now, let's evaluate the assertion `assert(prime_fib(3) == 5)`:

  - the 1st prime fibonacci number is 2.
  - the 2nd prime fibonacci number is 3.
  - the 3rd prime fibonacci number is 5.

since the function is expected to return the 3rd prime fibonacci number, which is indeed 5, the assertion `assert(prime_fib(3) == 5)` should pass.

2. **fibonacci sequence generation**:
   - the fibonacci sequence is generated using two variables `f1` and `f2`, initialized to 1 and 2, respectively.
   - the loop continues until `count` reaches `n`, where `count` tracks how many prime fibonacci numbers have been found.

3. **prime checking**:

   - if a divisor is found, `isprime` is set to false.

4. **count increment**:
   - if the fibonacci number is prime, `count` is incremented.
   - when `count` equals `n`, the function returns the current fibonacci number.

### testing the assertion
