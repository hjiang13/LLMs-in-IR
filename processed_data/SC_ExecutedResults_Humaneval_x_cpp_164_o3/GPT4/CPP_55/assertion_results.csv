assert (fib(10) == 55);,pass,"to analyze the provided c/c++ code and the assertion statement, let's break down the function `fib(int n)` and see how it computes the fibonacci numbers.

### code analysis

1. **function purpose**: the function `fib(int n)` is designed to return the n-th fibonacci number.
2. **fibonacci sequence**: the fibonacci sequence is defined as:
   - f(0) = 0
   - f(1) = 1
   - f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) for n >= 2

3. **array initialization**: 
   - an array `f` of size 1000 is declared to store fibonacci numbers.
   - the first two fibonacci numbers are initialized: `f[0] = 0` and `f[1] = 1`.

4. **loop for calculation**:
   - a loop runs from `i = 2` to `i = n`, calculating each fibonacci number based on the previous two numbers:
     - `f[i] = f[i-1] + f[i-2]`.

5. **return value**: the function returns `f[n]`, which is the n-th fibonacci number.

### assertion analysis
the assertion statement is:
```cpp
assert (fib(10) == 55);
```

- we need to check if `fib(10)` indeed returns `55`.
- let's compute the fibonacci numbers up to `n = 10`:
  - f(0) = 0
  - f(1) = 1
  - f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 1 + 0 = 1
  - f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 1 + 1 = 2
  - f(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 2 + 1 = 3
  - f(5) = f(4) + f(3) = 3 + 2 = 5
  - f(6) = f(5) + f(4) = 5 + 3 = 8
  - f(7) = f(6) + f(5) = 8 + 5 = 13
  - f(8) = f(7) + f(6) = 13 + 8 = 21
  - f(9) = f(8) + f(7) = 21 + 13 = 34
  - f(10) = f(9) + f(8) = 34 + 21 = 55

from the calculations, we find that `fib(10)` indeed returns `55`.

### final result
based on the analysis, the assertion passes.

- **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (fib(1) == 1);,pass,"to analyze the provided c/c++ code and the assertion statement, let's break down the function `fib(int n)` and the assertion itself.

### code analysis
1. **function purpose**: the function `fib(int n)` is designed to return the n-th fibonacci number.
2. **fibonacci sequence**: the fibonacci sequence starts with `f(0) = 0`, `f(1) = 1`, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones: `f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)`.
3. **array initialization**: 
   - an array `f[1000]` is created to store fibonacci numbers up to the 999th index.
   - the first two fibonacci numbers are initialized: `f[0] = 0` and `f[1] = 1`.
4. **loop for calculation**: a loop runs from `i = 2` to `i = n`, calculating each fibonacci number and storing it in the array.
5. **return statement**: the function returns `f[n]`, which is the n-th fibonacci number.

### assertion analysis
the assertion statement is:
```cpp
assert (fib(1) == 1);
```
- we need to evaluate `fib(1)`:
  - according to the fibonacci sequence:
    - `f(0) = 0`
    - `f(1) = 1`
  - when `n = 1`, the function will return `f[1]`, which is initialized to `1`.

### conclusion
since `fib(1)` correctly returns `1`, the assertion `assert (fib(1) == 1);` will pass.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (fib(8) == 21);,pass,"to analyze the provided c/c++ code and the assertion statement, let's break down the function and the assertion step by step.

### code analysis
the function `fib(int n)` is designed to return the n-th fibonacci number. the fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:
- `f(0) = 0`
- `f(1) = 1`
- for `n >= 2`, `f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)`

the code initializes an array `f` of size 1000 to store fibonacci numbers. it sets the first two fibonacci numbers:
- `f[0] = 0`
- `f[1] = 1`

then, it uses a loop to calculate fibonacci numbers from `f[2]` to `f[n]`:
```cpp
for (int i=2; i<=n; i++)
    f[i] = f[i-1] + f[i-2];
```

finally, the function returns `f[n]`, which is the n-th fibonacci number.

### assertion statement
the assertion statement is:
```cpp
assert(fib(8) == 21);
```

### calculation of fibonacci numbers
let's calculate the fibonacci numbers up to `f(8)`:
- `f(0) = 0`
- `f(1) = 1`
- `f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 1 + 0 = 1`
- `f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 1 + 1 = 2`
- `f(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 2 + 1 = 3`
- `f(5) = f(4) + f(3) = 3 + 2 = 5`
- `f(6) = f(5) + f(4) = 5 + 3 = 8`
- `f(7) = f(6) + f(5) = 8 + 5 = 13`
- `f(8) = f(7) + f(6) = 13 + 8 = 21`

from the calculations, we see that `fib(8)` indeed returns `21`.

### conclusion
since the assertion `assert(fib(8) == 21);` checks if the function returns the correct fibonacci number for `n = 8`, and we have confirmed that `fib(8)` returns `21`, the assertion will pass.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (fib(11) == 89);,pass,"to analyze whether the assertion `assert (fib(11) == 89);` passes or fails based on the provided c/c++ code, we need to understand how the fibonacci sequence is generated in the `fib` function.

### fibonacci sequence
the fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:
- f(0) = 0
- f(1) = 1
- f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) for n >= 2

the first few fibonacci numbers are:
- f(0) = 0
- f(1) = 1
- f(2) = 1
- f(3) = 2
- f(4) = 3
- f(5) = 5
- f(6) = 8
- f(7) = 13
- f(8) = 21
- f(9) = 34
- f(10) = 55
- f(11) = 89

### analyzing the code
the provided `fib` function initializes an array `f` to store fibonacci numbers up to `f[n]`. it sets the first two fibonacci numbers and then uses a loop to calculate subsequent fibonacci numbers up to `n`.

1. **initialization**:
   - `f[0] = 0`
   - `f[1] = 1`

2. **loop**:
   - the loop runs from `i = 2` to `i = n`, calculating `f[i]` as the sum of the two preceding fibonacci numbers:
     - `f[i] = f[i-1] + f[i-2]`

3. **return value**:
   - the function returns `f[n]`.

### evaluating the assertion
now, we need to evaluate `fib(11)`:
- according to the fibonacci sequence:
  - f(11) = f(10) + f(9) = 55 + 34 = 89

thus, `fib(11)` correctly computes to 89.

### conclusion
since `fib(11)` returns 89, the assertion `assert (fib(11) == 89);` will pass.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (fib(12) == 144);,pass,"to analyze the provided c/c++ code and the assertion statement, let's break down the function and the assertion step by step.

### code analysis

1. **function purpose**: the function `fib(int n)` is designed to return the n-th fibonacci number. the fibonacci sequence is defined as:
   - f(0) = 0
   - f(1) = 1
   - f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) for n >= 2

2. **array initialization**: the function initializes an array `f` of size 1000 to store fibonacci numbers. the first two fibonacci numbers are explicitly set:
   - `f[0] = 0`
   - `f[1] = 1`

3. **fibonacci calculation**: the function then uses a loop to calculate fibonacci numbers from 2 up to `n`:
   - for each `i` from 2 to `n`, it computes `f[i]` as the sum of the two preceding fibonacci numbers: `f[i] = f[i-1] + f[i-2]`.

4. **return value**: finally, the function returns `f[n]`, which is the n-th fibonacci number.

### assertion analysis

now, let's evaluate the assertion statement:
```cpp
assert (fib(12) == 144);
```

5. **calculating fibonacci(12)**:
   - f(0) = 0
   - f(1) = 1
   - f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 1 + 0 = 1
   - f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 1 + 1 = 2
   - f(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 2 + 1 = 3
   - f(5) = f(4) + f(3) = 3 + 2 = 5
   - f(6) = f(5) + f(4) = 5 + 3 = 8
   - f(7) = f(6) + f(5) = 8 + 5 = 13
   - f(8) = f(7) + f(6) = 13 + 8 = 21
   - f(9) = f(8) + f(7) = 21 + 13 = 34
   - f(10) = f(9) + f(8) = 34 + 21 = 55
   - f(11) = f(10) + f(9) = 55 + 34 = 89
   - f(12) = f(11) + f(10) = 89 + 55 = 144

6. **comparison**: the computed value of `fib(12)` is 144, which matches the right-hand side of the assertion.

### final result

since the computed value of `fib(12)` is indeed equal to 144, the assertion passes.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
