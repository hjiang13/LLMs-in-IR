### breakdown of the `common` function:

1. **input vectors**: the function takes two vectors `l1` and `l2`.
2. **output vector**: an empty vector `out` is initialized to store the common unique elements.
3. **loop through `l1`**: the function iterates through each element of `l1`.
   - for each element `l1[i]`, it checks if it is already in `out` using `find`. if it is not found in `out`, it proceeds to the next check.
   - it then checks if `l1[i]` is present in `l2` using another `find`. if it is found in `l2`, it adds `l1[i]` to `out`.
4. **sorting**: after collecting all common unique elements, the `out` vector is sorted.
5. **return**: finally, the sorted vector `out` is returned.

### analyzing the assertion:

the assertion we need to evaluate is:
```cpp
assert (issame(common({1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5}, {5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121}) , {1, 5, 653}));
```

1. **input vectors**:
   - `l1 = {1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5}`
   - `l2 = {5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121}`

2. **finding common unique elements**:
   - start with `out = {}`.
   - check each element of `l1`:
     - `1`: not in `out`, found in `l2` → `out = {1}`
     - `4`: not in `out`, not found in `l2` → `out remains {1}`
     - `3`: not in `out`, not found in `l2` → `out remains {1}`
     - `34`: not in `out`, not found in `l2` → `out remains {1}`
     - `653`: not in `out`, found in `l2` → `out = {1, 653}`
     - `2`: not in `out`, not found in `l2` → `out remains {1, 653}`
     - `5`: not in `out`, found in `l2` → `out = {1, 653, 5}`

3. **sorting the output**:
   - before sorting, `out = {1, 653, 5}`.
   - after sorting, `out = {1, 5, 653}`.

4. **expected output**:
   - the expected output from the assertion is `{1, 5, 653}`.

5. **comparison**:
   - the output from the function `common` is `{1, 5, 653}`, which matches the expected output `{1, 5, 653}`.

### conclusion:
since the output of the `common` function matches the expected output in the assertion, the assertion will pass.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(common({5, 3, 2, 8}, {3, 2}) , {2, 3}));",pass,"to analyze whether the assertion passes or fails, we need to break down the provided c++ function `common` and understand its behavior with the given input.

### step-by-step analysis

1. **function purpose**: the function `common` is designed to return a sorted vector of unique common elements between two input vectors `l1` and `l2`.

2. **input vectors**: the assertion tests the function with the input vectors `{5, 3, 2, 8}` and `{3, 2}`.

3. **function logic**:
   - it initializes an empty vector `out` to store the common elements.
   - it iterates through each element of `l1`:
     - it checks if the element is already in `out` (to ensure uniqueness).
     - it checks if the element exists in `l2`.
     - if both conditions are satisfied, it adds the element to `out`.
   - finally, it sorts the `out` vector before returning it.

4. **execution with given input**:
   - for `l1 = {5, 3, 2, 8}`:
     - check `5`: not in `out`, not in `l2` → skip.
     - check `3`: not in `out`, in `l2` → add `3` to `out`.
     - check `2`: not in `out`, in `l2` → add `2` to `out`.
     - check `8`: not in `out`, not in `l2` → skip.
   - at this point, `out` contains `{3, 2}`.
   - the function then sorts `out`, resulting in `{2, 3}`.

5. **assertion check**:
   - the assertion checks if the result of `common({5, 3, 2, 8}, {3, 2})` is the same as `{2, 3}`.
   - since the function returns `{2, 3}`, the assertion will pass.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"

### assertion breakdown
the assertion we need to evaluate is:

assert (issame(common({4, 3, 2, 8}, {3, 2, 4}) , {2, 3, 4}));
```

1. **input vectors**:
   - `l1 = {4, 3, 2, 8}`
   - `l2 = {3, 2, 4}`

2. **execution of `common`**:
   - start with `out = {}`.
   - check `4`: not in `out`, but it is in `l2`. so, `out = {4}`.
   - check `3`: not in `out`, and it is in `l2`. so, `out = {4, 3}`.
   - check `2`: not in `out`, and it is in `l2`. so, `out = {4, 3, 2}`.
   - check `8`: not in `out`, but it is not in `l2`. so, `out` remains `{4, 3, 2}`.
   
3. **sorting**: the `out` vector `{4, 3, 2}` is sorted to become `{2, 3, 4}`.

4. **final output**: the function returns `{2, 3, 4}`.

5. **assertion check**: the assertion checks if the output of `common` is the same as `{2, 3, 4}`. since the output is indeed `{2, 3, 4}`, the assertion will pass.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(common({4, 3, 2, 8}, {}) , {}));",pass,"to analyze whether the assertion passes or fails, let's break down the provided c++ code and the assertion statement.

### code analysis
the function `common` is designed to return a vector of sorted unique common elements from two input vectors `l1` and `l2`. here's how it works:

1. **initialization**: an empty vector `out` is initialized to store the common elements.
2. **first loop**: the function iterates over each element in `l1`.
   - it checks if the current element `l1[i]` is already in `out`. if it is not, it proceeds to the next check.
   - it checks if `l1[i]` exists in `l2`. if it does, it adds `l1[i]` to `out`.
3. **sorting**: after collecting all common elements, the `out` vector is sorted.
4. **return**: finally, the sorted vector of common elements is returned.

### assertion statement
the assertion statement is:
```cpp
assert (issame(common({4, 3, 2, 8}, {}) , {}));
```

this assertion checks if the result of the `common` function when called with the first vector `{4, 3, 2, 8}` and the second vector `{}` (an empty vector) is the same as an empty vector `{}`.

### step-by-step execution
1. **input vectors**: the first vector `l1` is `{4, 3, 2, 8}` and the second vector `l2` is `{}` (empty).
2. **loop execution**:
   - for `l1[0]` (4): it's not in `out`, but it also isn't in `l2`, so it is not added.
   - for `l1[1]` (3): same as above, not added.
   - for `l1[2]` (2): same as above, not added.
   - for `l1[3]` (8): same as above, not added.
3. **final output**: since no elements from `l1` were found in `l2`, the `out` vector remains empty.
4. **sorting**: sorting an empty vector still results in an empty vector.
5. **return value**: the function returns an empty vector `{}`.

### comparison
the assertion checks if the result of `common({4, 3, 2, 8}, {})` is the same as `{}`. since both are indeed empty vectors, the assertion will pass.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
