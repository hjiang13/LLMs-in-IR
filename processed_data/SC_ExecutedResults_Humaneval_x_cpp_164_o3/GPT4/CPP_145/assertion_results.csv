"assert (issame(order_by_points({1, 11, -1, -11, -12}) , {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}));",fail,"to analyze whether the assertion passes or fails, we need to closely examine the provided c++ function `order_by_points` and understand how it processes the input vector of integers.

### step-by-step analysis

1. **understanding the function**:
   - the function takes a vector of integers `nums` as input.
   - it calculates the sum of the digits for each integer in `nums` and stores these sums in a separate vector `sumdigit`.
   - the function then sorts `nums` based on the values in `sumdigit`. if two integers have the same digit sum, they retain their original order (this is known as a stable sort).

2. **calculating the digit sums**:
   - for each integer in `nums`, the function converts it to a string representation of its absolute value.
   - it calculates the sum of the digits:
     - if the number is positive, it adds the first digit to the sum.
     - if the number is negative, it subtracts the first digit from the sum.
   - the loop starts from index 1 for the string representation, which means it skips the first character (the sign).

3. **sorting logic**:
   - the sorting is done using a simple bubble sort algorithm, which is not the most efficient but works for small vectors.
   - the sorting is based on the digit sums stored in `sumdigit`.

4. **test case**:
   - we need to evaluate the assertion:
     ```cpp
     assert (issame(order_by_points({1, 11, -1, -11, -12}) , {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}));
     ```
   - let's calculate the digit sums for the input `{1, 11, -1, -11, -12}`:
     - `1`: sum of digits = 1
     - `11`: sum of digits = 1 + 1 = 2
     - `-1`: sum of digits = -1 (since we subtract the first digit)
     - `-11`: sum of digits = -1 (same reasoning as above)
     - `-12`: sum of digits = -1 + 2 = 1

   - the calculated sums are:
     - `1` -> 1
     - `11` -> 2
     - `-1` -> -1
     - `-11` -> -1
     - `-12` -> 1

   - the `sumdigit` vector will be: `{1, 2, -1, -1, 1}`.

5. **sorting based on digit sums**:
   - the sorting will prioritize the digit sums:
     - `-1` (from `-1` and `-11`) comes first (they are equal, but `-1` appears first in the original vector).
     - then `1` (from `1` and `-12`), with `-12` appearing before `1` in the original vector.
     - finally, `11` with a digit sum of `2`.

   - the sorted order based on digit sums will be:
     - `-1` (sum -1)
     - `-11` (sum -1)
     - `-12` (sum 1)
     - `1` (sum 1)
     - `11` (sum 2)

   - therefore, the final sorted vector will be `{-1, -11, -12, 1, 11}`.

6. **comparing with expected output**:
   - the expected output from the assertion is `{-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}`.
   - however, the actual output from the function is `{-1, -11, -12, 1, 11}`.

### conclusion
since the output does not match the expected output, the assertion will fail.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **fail**"
"assert (issame(order_by_points({1234,423,463,145,2,423,423,53,6,37,3457,3,56,0,46}) , {0, 2, 3, 6, 53, 423, 423, 423, 1234, 145, 37, 46, 56, 463, 3457}));",pass,"to analyze whether the provided assertion passes or fails, we need to break down the function `order_by_points` and understand how it processes the input vector of integers.

### step-by-step analysis

1. **understanding the function**:
   - the function takes a vector of integers `nums`.
   - it calculates the sum of the digits for each integer in `nums`.
   - it stores these sums in a vector called `sumdigit`.
   - the function then sorts `nums` based on the values in `sumdigit` using a simple bubble sort algorithm.

2. **calculating the sum of digits**:
   - the function converts each integer to its absolute value and then to a string.
   - it calculates the sum of the digits:
     - for positive numbers, it adds the first digit (most significant) to the sum.
     - for negative numbers, it subtracts the first digit from the sum.
   - the loop starts from index `1` for the string representation, which means it skips the first character (the most significant digit) in the sum calculation.

3. **sorting logic**:
   - the sorting is done using a nested loop (bubble sort).
   - it compares the sums in `sumdigit` and swaps the corresponding elements in `nums` if they are out of order.

4. **testing the assertion**:
   - the assertion checks if the output of `order_by_points` for the input `{1234,423,463,145,2,423,423,53,6,37,3457,3,56,0,46}` matches the expected output `{0, 2, 3, 6, 53, 423, 423, 423, 1234, 145, 37, 46, 56, 463, 3457}`.

5. **calculating the sums for the given input**:
   - for `1234`: sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10
   - for `423`: sum = 4 + 2 + 3 = 9
   - for `463`: sum = 4 + 6 + 3 = 13
   - for `145`: sum = 1 + 4 + 5 = 10
   - for `2`: sum = 2 = 2
   - for `423`: sum = 9 (same as above)
   - for `423`: sum = 9 (same as above)
   - for `53`: sum = 5 + 3 = 8
   - for `6`: sum = 6 = 6
   - for `37`: sum = 3 + 7 = 10
   - for `3457`: sum = 3 + 4 + 5 + 7 = 19
   - for `3`: sum = 3 = 3
   - for `56`: sum = 5 + 6 = 11
   - for `0`: sum = 0 = 0
   - for `46`: sum = 4 + 6 = 10

   the sums are:
   ```
   {10, 9, 13, 10, 2, 9, 9, 8, 6, 10, 19, 3, 11, 0, 10}
   ```

6. **sorting based on sums**:
   - the sorted order based on the sums (and original indices for ties) should yield:
   ```
   {0 (sum 0), 2 (sum 2), 3 (sum 3), 6 (sum 6), 53 (sum 8), 
   423 (sum 9), 423 (sum 9), 423 (sum 9), 
   1234 (sum 10), 145 (sum 10), 37 (sum 10), 46 (sum 10), 
   56 (sum 11), 463 (sum 13), 3457 (sum 19)}
   ```

   this results in:
   ```
   {0, 2, 3, 6, 53, 423, 423, 423, 1234, 145, 37, 46, 56, 463, 3457}
   ```

7. **comparing with expected output**:
   - the output from the function matches the expected output from the assertion.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(order_by_points({}) , {}));",pass,"to analyze whether the provided assertion passes or fails, we need to carefully examine the function `order_by_points` and how it handles the input vector of integers.

### step-by-step analysis

1. **function purpose**: the function `order_by_points` is designed to sort a vector of integers based on the sum of their digits. if two integers have the same digit sum, they should maintain their original order.

2. **input handling**: the assertion checks the output of `order_by_points({})`, which means we are passing an empty vector to the function.

3. **function execution**:
   - the function starts by initializing an empty vector `sumdigit`.
   - it then enters a loop to iterate over the elements of `nums`. however, since `nums` is empty, the loop does not execute at all.
   - after the loop, the function contains another nested loop intended for sorting based on the `sumdigit` vector. again, since `nums` is empty, this loop does not execute either.
   - finally, the function returns the `nums` vector, which remains unchanged (still empty).

4. **expected output**: since the input vector is empty, the expected output of `order_by_points({})` is also an empty vector `{}`.

5. **assertion check**: the assertion checks if the output of `order_by_points({})` is the same as an empty vector `{}`. since both the output and the expected output are empty vectors, the assertion should pass.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(order_by_points({1, -11, -32, 43, 54, -98, 2, -3}) , {-3, -32, -98, -11, 1, 2, 43, 54}));",fail,"to analyze whether the assertion passes or fails, we need to break down the provided function `order_by_points` and understand how it processes the input vector of integers.

   - the function then sorts the `nums` vector based on the values in `sumdigit`. if two numbers have the same digit sum, they retain their original order (this is known as a stable sort).

2. **calculating the digit sums**:
   - for each number in `nums`, the absolute value is converted to a string.
   - the sum of the digits is calculated. the first character (most significant digit) is treated differently based on whether the number is positive or negative:
     - if the number is positive, the first digit is added to the sum.
     - if the number is negative, the first digit is subtracted from the sum.
   - the loop iterates through the string representation of the number, starting from the second character, to sum the remaining digits.

3. **sorting logic**:
   - the sorting is done using a simple bubble sort algorithm, which is not the most efficient but will suffice for small vectors.
   - the sorting is based on the `sumdigit` vector, ensuring that if two numbers have the same digit sum, their original order is preserved.

4. **testing the assertion**:
   - the assertion checks if the output of `order_by_points({1, -11, -32, 43, 54, -98, 2, -3})` is equal to `{-3, -32, -98, -11, 1, 2, 43, 54}`.
   - we need to calculate the digit sums for each number in the input vector:
     - `1`: sum = 1
     - `-11`: sum = 1 - 1 = 0
     - `-32`: sum = 3 - 2 = 1
     - `43`: sum = 4 + 3 = 7
     - `54`: sum = 5 + 4 = 9
     - `-98`: sum = 9 - 8 = 1
     - `2`: sum = 2
     - `-3`: sum = 3 - 0 = 3

   - the digit sums are:
     - `1` -> 1
     - `-11` -> 0
     - `-32` -> 1
     - `43` -> 7
     - `54` -> 9
     - `-98` -> 1
     - `2` -> 2
     - `-3` -> 3

5. **sorting based on digit sums**:
   - the sorted order based on digit sums (and original order for ties) would be:
     - `-11` (0)
     - `1` (1)
     - `-32` (1)
     - `-98` (1)
     - `2` (2)
     - `-3` (3)
     - `43` (7)
     - `54` (9)

   - this results in the order: `{-11, 1, -32, -98, 2, -3, 43, 54}`.

6. **comparing with expected output**:
   - the expected output from the assertion is `{-3, -32, -98, -11, 1, 2, 43, 54}`.
   - the actual output from our sorting is `{-11, 1, -32, -98, 2, -3, 43, 54}`.
   - since the outputs do not match, the assertion fails.

### breakdown of the function

1. **input vector**: the function takes a vector of integers `nums`.

2. **calculating digit sums**:
   - the function creates a new vector `sumdigit` to store the sum of the digits of each integer in `nums`.
   - for each integer, it converts the absolute value of the integer to a string and calculates the sum of its digits.
   - the first character (most significant digit) is treated differently based on whether the integer is positive or negative:

### analyzing the assertion

the assertion checks if the output of `order_by_points({1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11})` is equal to `{1, 10, 2, 11, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}`.

#### step-by-step calculation

1. **input**: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}`
2. **calculating digit sums**:
   - `1`: sum = 1
   - `2`: sum = 2
   - `3`: sum = 3
   - `4`: sum = 4
   - `5`: sum = 5
   - `6`: sum = 6
   - `7`: sum = 7
   - `8`: sum = 8
   - `9`: sum = 9
   - `10`: sum = 1 + 0 = 1
   - `11`: sum = 1 + 1 = 2

   so, the `sumdigit` vector will be: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2}`.

3. **sorting**:
   - the sorting will be based on the `sumdigit` values:
     - `1` (from `1` and `10`), `10` comes after `1` because of its original index.
     - `2` (from `2` and `11`), `2` comes before `11` because of its original index.
     - the rest (`3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`) remain in their original order.

   after sorting, the final order will be: `{1, 10, 2, 11, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}`.

### conclusion

the output of `order_by_points({1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11})` matches the expected output `{1, 10, 2, 11, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}`.

### step-by-step analysis of the function

1. **input vector**: the function takes a vector of integers as input.

2. **sum of digits calculation**:
   - the function initializes an empty vector `sumdigit` to store the sum of digits for each number in the input vector.
   - it iterates through each number in the input vector `nums`.
   - for each number, it converts it to a string representation of its absolute value.
   - it calculates the sum of the digits:
     - if the number is positive, it adds the first digit to the sum.
     - if the number is negative, it subtracts the first digit from the sum.
   - the sum of digits is stored in the `sumdigit` vector.

3. **sorting logic**:
   - the function uses a simple bubble sort algorithm to sort both `sumdigit` and `nums` based on the sum of digits.
   - if two numbers have the same sum of digits, their order in the original vector is preserved.

4. **return value**: the function returns the sorted vector `nums`.

### analyzing the assertion

the assertion checks if the output of `order_by_points({0,6,6,-76,-21,23,4})` is equal to `{-76, -21, 0, 4, 23, 6, 6}`.

#### step 1: calculate the sum of digits for each element
- `0`: sum = 0
- `6`: sum = 6
- `6`: sum = 6
- `-76`: sum = 7 (since -7 + 6 = -1, but we take the absolute value)
- `-21`: sum = 3 (since -2 + 1 = -1, but we take the absolute value)
- `23`: sum = 5 (2 + 3 = 5)
- `4`: sum = 4 (4 = 4)

#### step 2: create the `sumdigit` vector
the `sumdigit` vector will be:
- `sumdigit = {0, 6, 6, 7, 3, 5, 4}`

#### step 3: sort the `sumdigit` and corresponding `nums`
using bubble sort, we will sort based on the `sumdigit` values:
- `-76` (7)
- `-21` (3)
- `0` (0)
- `4` (4)
- `23` (5)
- `6` (6)
- `6` (6)

the sorted order based on the sum of digits will be:
1. `-76` (7)
2. `-21` (3)
3. `0` (0)
4. `4` (4)
5. `23` (5)
6. `6` (6)
7. `6` (6)

this matches the expected output of `{-76, -21, 0, 4, 23, 6, 6}`.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
