assert (sum_to_n(1) == 1);,pass,"to analyze the assertion statement `assert (sum_to_n(1) == 1);`, we need to evaluate the function `sum_to_n` with the input `1` and check if the output matches the expected value of `1`.

### step-by-step analysis

1. **understanding the function**:
   - the function `sum_to_n(int n)` is designed to calculate the sum of all integers from `1` to `n`.
   - the formula used in the function is `n * (n + 1) / 2`, which is a well-known mathematical formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.

2. **evaluating the function for `n = 1`**:
   - we substitute `n` with `1` in the function:
     ```
     sum_to_n(1) = 1 * (1 + 1) / 2
                  = 1 * 2 / 2
                  = 2 / 2
                  = 1
     ```

3. **checking the assertion**:
   - the assertion statement checks if the result of `sum_to_n(1)` is equal to `1`.
   - from our evaluation, we found that `sum_to_n(1)` indeed returns `1`.
   - therefore, the assertion `assert (sum_to_n(1) == 1);` holds true.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (sum_to_n(6) == 21);,pass,"to analyze whether the provided assertion passes or fails, we need to evaluate the function `sum_to_n(int n)` and the specific assertion statement.

### step-by-step analysis

1. **understanding the function**:
   the function `sum_to_n(int n)` is designed to calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to `n`. the formula used in the function is:
   \[
   \text{sum} = \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   this formula is derived from the arithmetic series sum formula.

2. **evaluating the assertion**:
   the assertion statement is:
   ```cpp
   assert (sum_to_n(6) == 21);
   ```
   we need to compute `sum_to_n(6)` using the function.

3. **calculating `sum_to_n(6)`**:
   plugging `n = 6` into the formula:
   \[
   \text{sum_to_n}(6) = \frac{6 \times (6 + 1)}{2} = \frac{6 \times 7}{2} = \frac{42}{2} = 21
   \]

4. **comparing with the assertion**:
   the assertion checks if `sum_to_n(6)` equals `21`. from our calculation, we found that `sum_to_n(6)` indeed equals `21`.

5. **conclusion**:
   since the calculated value matches the expected value in the assertion, the assertion will pass.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"

3. **calculating `sum_to_n(11)`**:
   using the formula:
   \[

assert (sum_to_n(100) == 5050);,pass,"to analyze the provided c/c++ code and the assertion statement, we need to evaluate the function `sum_to_n(int n)` and determine if it correctly computes the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.

### step-by-step analysis

1. **understanding the function**:
   the function `sum_to_n(int n)` is defined as:
   ```cpp
   return n * (n + 1) / 2;
   ```
   this formula is derived from the mathematical formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is:
   \[
   s = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   this means that for any positive integer `n`, the function should return the correct sum.

2. **evaluating the assertion**:
   the assertion we need to evaluate is:
   ```cpp
   assert(sum_to_n(100) == 5050);
   ```
   we will compute `sum_to_n(100)` using the function:
   - plugging `n = 100` into the formula:
   \[
   sum\_to\_n(100) = \frac{100 \times (100 + 1)}{2} = \frac{100 \times 101}{2} = \frac{10100}{2} = 5050
   \]

3. **comparison**:
   now we compare the computed value:
   - `sum_to_n(100)` yields `5050`.
   - the assertion checks if this value is equal to `5050`.

4. **conclusion**:
   since `sum_to_n(100)` indeed equals `5050`, the assertion passes.
