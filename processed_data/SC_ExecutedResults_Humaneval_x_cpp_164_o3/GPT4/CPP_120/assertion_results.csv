"assert (issame(maximum({-3, -4, 5}, 3) , {-4, -3, 5}));",pass,"to analyze the provided c++ code and the assertion statement, let's break down the function and the assertion step by step.

### code analysis

1. **function purpose**: the function `maximum` is designed to return the `k` largest numbers from the input vector `arr`, sorted in ascending order.

2. **input parameters**:
   - `arr`: a vector of integers.
   - `k`: a positive integer indicating how many of the largest numbers to return.

3. **function logic**:
   - the function first sorts the input vector `arr` in ascending order using `sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());`.
   - it then creates a new vector `out` that contains the last `k` elements of the sorted vector, which are the largest `k` elements.
   - the line `vector<int> out(arr.end()-k, arr.end());` constructs the vector `out` using the range from `arr.end()-k` to `arr.end()`, effectively taking the last `k` elements.

4. **output**: the function returns the vector `out`.

### assertion analysis

now, let's analyze the assertion statement:

```cpp
assert (issame(maximum({-3, -4, 5}, 3) , {-4, -3, 5}));
```

- **input to `maximum`**: the input vector is `{-3, -4, 5}` and `k` is `3`.
- **sorting the input**: after sorting, the vector becomes `{-4, -3, 5}`.
- **selecting the largest `k` elements**: since `k` is `3`, we take all elements from the sorted vector, which results in `{-4, -3, 5}`.
- **expected output**: the expected output from the assertion is also `{-4, -3, 5}`.

### comparison with `issame`

assuming `issame` is a function that checks if two vectors are equal (in terms of both size and content), we can compare the output of `maximum` with the expected vector.

- the output from `maximum({-3, -4, 5}, 3)` is `{-4, -3, 5}`.
- the expected vector is also `{-4, -3, 5}`.

since both vectors are equal, the assertion will pass.

### final result

based on the analysis above, we conclude:

- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(maximum({4, -4, 4}, 2) , {4, 4}));",pass,"to analyze whether the provided assertion passes or fails, we need to break down the code and understand how the function `maximum` works, particularly with the input provided in the assertion.

### code analysis

1. **function purpose**: the function `maximum` is designed to return the `k` largest elements from the input vector `arr`, sorted in ascending order.

2. **sorting**: the first operation in the function is `sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());`, which sorts the entire vector `arr` in ascending order.

3. **extracting the largest elements**: the line `vector<int> out(arr.end()-k, arr.end());` creates a new vector `out` that contains the last `k` elements of the sorted vector `arr`. since `arr` is sorted in ascending order, these last `k` elements will be the largest `k` elements from the original vector.

4. **return value**: the function returns the vector `out`.

### assertion breakdown

now, let's analyze the specific assertion:
```cpp
assert (issame(maximum({4, -4, 4}, 2) , {4, 4}));
```

- **input to `maximum`**: the input vector is `{4, -4, 4}` and `k = 2`.
- **sorting the input**: after sorting, the vector becomes `{-4, 4, 4}`.
- **extracting the largest 2 elements**: the last 2 elements of the sorted vector are `{4, 4}`.
- **return value**: therefore, `maximum({4, -4, 4}, 2)` returns `{4, 4}`.

### comparison with expected output

the expected output in the assertion is `{4, 4}`. since the function returns `{4, 4}`, we need to check if the comparison function `issame` correctly identifies that both vectors are equal.

assuming `issame` is a function that checks for equality of two vectors, it should return `true` for the vectors `{4, 4}` and `{4, 4}`.

### final result

since the output of the function matches the expected output in the assertion, we conclude that the assertion passes.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(maximum({-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1}, 1) , {2}));",pass,"to analyze the provided c++ code and the assertion statement, we need to break down the function and the assertion step by step.

### code analysis
1. **function purpose**: the function `maximum` is designed to return a sorted vector of the maximum `k` numbers from the input vector `arr`.

2. **sorting**: the function first sorts the entire vector `arr` in ascending order using `sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());`.

3. **extracting maximum k elements**: after sorting, the function creates a new vector `out` that contains the last `k` elements of the sorted vector. this is done using the expression `vector<int> out(arr.end()-k, arr.end());`. the last `k` elements will be the largest `k` elements from the original vector.

4. **return value**: the function returns the vector `out`, which contains the maximum `k` elements.

1. **input vector**: the input vector is `{-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1}` and `k` is `1`.

2. **sorting the input vector**: after sorting, the vector becomes `{-3, -2, -1, 1, 1, 2, 2}`.

3. **extracting maximum 1 element**: since `k` is `1`, we take the last `1` element from the sorted vector. the last element is `2`.

4. **expected output**: the expected output from the assertion is `{2}`.

5. **comparison**: the function will return `{2}`, and we need to check if this is the same as `{2}`. assuming `issame` is a function that checks if two vectors are equal, it will return `true` since both vectors contain the same single element.

### conclusion
since the function correctly extracts the maximum `k` elements and the assertion checks for equality with the expected output, the assertion will pass.

```cpp
assert (issame(maximum({123, -123, 20, 0 , 1, 2, -3}, 3) , {2, 20, 123}));
```

1. **input vector**: the input vector is `{123, -123, 20, 0, 1, 2, -3}`.

2. **value of k**: the value of `k` is `3`, meaning we want the top 3 maximum numbers from the input vector.

3. **sorting the input vector**: 
   - the sorted version of the input vector would be `{-123, -3, 0, 1, 2, 20, 123}`.

4. **extracting the maximum 3 elements**: 
   - the last 3 elements from the sorted vector are `{2, 20, 123}`.

5. **expected output**: the assertion checks if the output of the function matches `{2, 20, 123}`.

6. **comparison**: the expected output `{2, 20, 123}` matches the output from the function `maximum({123, -123, 20, 0 , 1, 2, -3}, 3)`.

### function analysis
the function `maximum` takes a vector of integers `arr` and an integer `k`. its purpose is to return a sorted vector containing the maximum `k` numbers from `arr`. 

1. **sorting**: the function first sorts the entire vector `arr` in ascending order using `sort(arr.begin(), arr.end())`.
2. **extracting maximum k elements**: after sorting, the function creates a new vector `out` that contains the last `k` elements of the sorted vector. this is done using the expression `arr.end() - k`, which points to the beginning of the last `k` elements.

### assertion breakdown
the assertion statement is:
```cpp
assert (issame(maximum({-123, 20, 0 , 1, 2, -3}, 4) , {0, 1, 2, 20}));
```

1. **input vector**: the input vector is `{-123, 20, 0, 1, 2, -3}`.
2. **value of k**: the value of `k` is `4`, meaning we want the maximum 4 elements from the input vector.
3. **sorting the input vector**: after sorting, the vector becomes:
   ```
   sorted: {-123, -3, 0, 1, 2, 20}
   ```
4. **extracting the maximum 4 elements**: the last 4 elements of the sorted vector are:
   ```
   {0, 1, 2, 20}
   ```
5. **expected output**: the expected output from the assertion is `{0, 1, 2, 20}`.

### comparison
the assertion checks if the output of the function `maximum` matches the expected output `{0, 1, 2, 20}`. since the function correctly extracts the maximum 4 elements from the sorted vector, the output will indeed be `{0, 1, 2, 20}`.

### code analysis

1. **function definition**:
   the function `maximum` takes a vector of integers `arr` and an integer `k`. it is supposed to return a sorted vector containing the maximum `k` numbers from `arr`.

2. **sorting**:
   the line `sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());` sorts the entire vector `arr` in ascending order.

3. **extracting maximum k elements**:
   the line `vector<int> out(arr.end()-k, arr.end());` creates a new vector `out` that contains the last `k` elements of the sorted vector `arr`. since `arr` is sorted in ascending order, these last `k` elements will be the largest `k` elements from the original vector.

4. **return statement**:
   the function returns the vector `out`.

### assertion analysis

the assertion in question is:
```cpp
assert (issame(maximum({5, 15, 0, 3, -13, -8, 0}, 7) , {-13, -8, 0, 0, 3, 5, 15}));
```

1. **input vector**: `{5, 15, 0, 3, -13, -8, 0}`
2. **value of k**: `7`
3. **length of input vector**: the input vector has 7 elements.

### expected behavior

- since `k` is equal to the length of the vector, the function should return all elements of the vector sorted in ascending order.
- sorting the vector `{5, 15, 0, 3, -13, -8, 0}` results in `{-13, -8, 0, 0, 3, 5, 15}`.

### assertion check

the assertion checks if the output of `maximum({5, 15, 0, 3, -13, -8, 0}, 7)` is the same as `{-13, -8, 0, 0, 3, 5, 15}`.

- the output of the function will indeed be `{-13, -8, 0, 0, 3, 5, 15}`.
- the assertion checks if the two vectors are the same, which they are.

- **input vector**: `{-1, 0, 2, 5, 3, -10}`
- **value of k**: `2`

#### step-by-step execution:

1. **sorting the input vector**:
   - the input vector `{-1, 0, 2, 5, 3, -10}` will be sorted to `{-10, -1, 0, 2, 3, 5}`.

2. **extracting the maximum k elements**:
   - since `k = 2`, we need the last 2 elements from the sorted vector.
   - the last 2 elements are `3` and `5`.

3. **result of the function**:
   - the function will return the vector `{3, 5}`.

### comparison with expected output

the assertion checks if the result of `maximum({-1, 0, 2, 5, 3, -10}, 2)` is the same as `{3, 5}`.

2. **sorting**: the function first sorts the entire vector `arr` using `sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());`. after sorting, the smallest elements will be at the beginning of the vector, and the largest elements will be at the end.

### function analysis
the function `maximum` is designed to return the largest `k` numbers from the input vector `arr`, sorted in ascending order. here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the function does:

1. **sorting**: the function first sorts the entire vector `arr` in ascending order using `sort(arr.begin(), arr.end())`.
2. **extracting maximums**: it then creates a new vector `out` that contains the last `k` elements of the sorted vector. this is done using `vector<int> out(arr.end()-k, arr.end())`, which constructs a vector from the range starting from `arr.end()-k` to `arr.end()`.
3. **return**: finally, it returns the vector `out`.

### assertion analysis
the assertion statement is:
```cpp
assert (issame(maximum({1, 2, 3, -23, 243, -400, 0}, 0) , {}));
```

1. **input vector**: the input vector is `{1, 2, 3, -23, 243, -400, 0}`.
2. **value of k**: the value of `k` is `0`.
3. **expected output**: the expected output is an empty vector `{}`.

### function execution with k = 0
when `k` is `0`, the following happens in the function:
- the vector `arr` is sorted, resulting in `{-400, -23, 0, 1, 2, 3, 243}`.
- the line `vector<int> out(arr.end()-k, arr.end())` translates to `vector<int> out(arr.end()-0, arr.end())`, which means it will take the entire range from the start of the vector to the end. however, since `k` is `0`, it effectively means that `out` will be an empty vector.

### conclusion
the function will return an empty vector when `k` is `0`, which matches the expected output of `{}` in the assertion. therefore, the assertion will pass.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
