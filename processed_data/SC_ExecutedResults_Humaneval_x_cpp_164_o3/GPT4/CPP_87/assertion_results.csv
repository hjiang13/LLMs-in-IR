assert (issame(get_row({,pass,"to analyze whether the provided assertion passes or fails based on the given c/c++ code, we need to break down the function `get_row` and understand its behavior with the provided examples.

### function analysis
the function `get_row` takes a 2d vector `lst` and an integer `x`. it searches for occurrences of `x` in the 2d vector and records their coordinates (row and column indices) in a new vector. the coordinates are stored in the format `{row, column}`.

1. **outer loop**: iterates through each row of the 2d vector `lst`.
2. **inner loop**: iterates through each column of the current row in reverse order (from the last column to the first).
3. **condition check**: if the current element equals `x`, it adds the coordinates `{i, j}` to the output vector `out`.
4. **return value**: the function returns the vector `out`, which contains all found coordinates.

### sorting requirements
the problem states that the output should be sorted:
- first by rows in ascending order.
- then by columns in descending order.

however, the current implementation does not sort the output. it simply adds the coordinates in the order they are found. this means that the output may not meet the sorting requirements.

### example analysis
let's analyze the provided examples to determine if the assertions will pass or fail.

1. **example 1**:
   ```cpp
   get_row({
     {1,2,3,4,5,6},
     {1,2,3,4,1,6},
     {1,2,3,4,5,1}
   }, 1) 
   ```
   - expected output: `{{0, 0}, {1, 4}, {1, 0}, {2, 5}, {2, 0}}`
   - found coordinates (in order of discovery): `{{0, 0}, {1, 4}, {1, 0}, {2, 5}, {2, 0}}`
   - the output matches the expected output, so this assertion will pass.

2. **example 2**:
   ```cpp
   get_row({}, 1) 
   ```
   - expected output: `{}`
   - the input is an empty vector, so the output will also be empty.
   - this assertion will pass.

3. **example 3**:
   ```cpp
   get_row({{}, {1}, {1, 2, 3}}, 3) 
   ```
   - expected output: `{{2, 2}}`
   - the only occurrence of `3` is at row `2`, column `2`.
   - the output will be `{{2, 2}}`, which matches the expected output.
   - this assertion will pass.

### final result
based on the analysis, all assertions will pass since the output of the function matches the expected results for each example.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**
- **assertion result**: **pass**
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (issame(get_row({,pass,"to analyze whether the assertion passes or fails based on the provided c/c++ code, we need to break down the function `get_row` and understand how it processes the input.

### function analysis
1. **input**: the function takes a 2d vector `lst` and an integer `x`.
2. **output**: it returns a vector of vectors containing the coordinates (row, column) of occurrences of `x` in `lst`.
3. **logic**:
   - it initializes an empty output vector `out`.
   - it iterates over each row `i` of `lst`.
   - for each row, it iterates backwards through the columns `j` (from the last column to the first).
   - if the element at `lst[i][j]` equals `x`, it adds the coordinate `{i, j}` to `out`.
4. **sorting**: the output is not explicitly sorted in the function, but since we are iterating backwards through each row, the coordinates for each row will be in descending order of columns. the rows themselves will be in ascending order because we iterate from the first row to the last.

### example assertions
now, let's analyze the provided examples in the comments and determine if the assertions would pass or fail.

1. **example 1**:
   ```cpp
   get_row({
     {1,2,3,4,5,6},
     {1,2,3,4,1,6},
     {1,2,3,4,5,1}
   }, 1) 
   ```
   - expected output: `{{0, 0}, {1, 4}, {1, 0}, {2, 5}, {2, 0}}`
   - actual output: the function will find `1` at:
     - row 0, column 0
     - row 1, column 4
     - row 1, column 0
     - row 2, column 5
     - row 2, column 0
   - the output matches the expected output.
   - **result**: **pass**

2. **example 2**:
   ```cpp
   get_row({}, 1) 
   ```
   - expected output: `{}`
   - actual output: the function will return an empty vector since there are no rows to process.
   - **result**: **pass**

3. **example 3**:
   ```cpp
   get_row({{}, {1}, {1, 2, 3}}, 3) 
   ```
   - expected output: `{{2, 2}}`
   - actual output: the function will find `3` at:
     - row 2, column 2 (which is the only occurrence of `3`).
   - the output matches the expected output.
   - **result**: **pass**

### final result
based on the analysis of the function and the provided examples, all assertions pass.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (issame(get_row({,pass,"to analyze whether the provided assertion passes or fails based on the given c/c++ code, we need to evaluate the function `get_row` and the expected output for the test cases provided in the comments.

### function analysis

the function `get_row` takes a 2d vector `lst` and an integer `x`. it searches for occurrences of `x` in the 2d vector and returns their coordinates in the form of a vector of vectors. the coordinates are structured as `{row, column}` pairs, where:
- `row` is the index of the row in which `x` is found.
- `column` is the index of the column in which `x` is found, but it is collected in reverse order (from the last column to the first).

the function does the following:
1. initializes an empty output vector `out`.
2. iterates through each row of the input vector `lst`.
3. for each row, it iterates through the columns in reverse order.
4. if the current element equals `x`, it adds the coordinate `{i, j}` to the output vector.
5. finally, it returns the output vector.

### expected output analysis

now, let's analyze the expected outputs for the provided examples:

1. **example 1**: 
   ```cpp
   get_row({
     {1,2,3,4,5,6},
     {1,2,3,4,1,6},
     {1,2,3,4,5,1}
   }, 1)
   ```
   - occurrences of `1`:
     - row 0: none
     - row 1: column 0 (1 at index 4)
     - row 2: column 0 (1 at index 5)
   - resulting coordinates: `{{0, 0}, {1, 4}, {1, 0}, {2, 5}, {2, 0}}`

2. **example 2**: 
   ```cpp
   get_row({}, 1)
   ```
   - the input is an empty vector, so there are no occurrences of `1`.
   - result: `{}`
   
3. **example 3**: 
   ```cpp
   get_row({{}, {1}, {1, 2, 3}}, 3)
   ```
   - occurrences of `3`:
     - row 0: none
     - row 1: none
     - row 2: column 2 (3 at index 2)
   - resulting coordinates: `{{2, 2}}`

### assertion statement

the assertion statement seems to be incomplete, but we can infer that it is checking the outputs of the function against the expected results.

### final result

based on the analysis above, we can conclude the results for each assertion:

1. for the first example, the expected output is `{{0, 0}, {1, 4}, {1, 0}, {2, 5}, {2, 0}}`. the function returns this correctly.
   - **assertion result**: **pass**

2. for the second example, the expected output is `{}`. the function returns this correctly.
   - **assertion result**: **pass**

3. for the third example, the expected output is `{{2, 2}}`. the function returns this correctly.
   - **assertion result**: **pass**

### final summary
all assertions based on the provided examples pass successfully.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**
- **assertion result**: **pass**
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(get_row({}, 1) , {}));",pass,"to analyze the assertion statement provided, we need to understand the behavior of the `get_row` function when it is called with the arguments `({}, 1)`.

### breakdown of the function

1. **function signature**: 
   the function `get_row` takes a 2d vector `lst` and an integer `x`. it is designed to find all occurrences of `x` in `lst` and return their coordinates as a vector of vectors.

2. **initialization**:
   the output vector `out` is initialized as an empty vector: `vector<vector<int>> out={};`.

3. **outer loop**:
   the outer loop iterates over each row of the 2d vector `lst` using `for (int i=0; i<lst.size(); i++)`.

4. **inner loop**:
   the inner loop iterates over each column of the current row in reverse order: `for (int j=lst[i].size()-1; j>=0; j-=1)`.

5. **condition check**:
   inside the inner loop, there is a condition that checks if the current element `lst[i][j]` is equal to `x`. if it is, the coordinates `{i, j}` are pushed into the output vector `out`.

6. **return statement**:
   finally, the function returns the `out` vector containing all found coordinates.

### analyzing the assertion

now, let's analyze the specific assertion:

```cpp
assert (issame(get_row({}, 1) , {}));
```

- the first argument to `get_row` is an empty vector `lst = {}`. this means there are no rows in the 2d vector.
- the second argument is `x = 1`, but since there are no elements in `lst`, there will be no occurrences of `1` to find.
- the outer loop `for (int i=0; i<lst.size(); i++)` will not execute because `lst.size()` is `0`.
- as a result, the function will skip both loops and directly return the empty output vector `out`, which was initialized as an empty vector.

### expected output

the expected output of `get_row({}, 1)` is an empty vector `{} (or vector<vector<int>>{})`. 

the assertion checks if the output of `get_row({}, 1)` is the same as an empty vector `{}`. since both are indeed empty vectors, the assertion will pass.

### final result

based on the analysis above, we can conclude:

- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(get_row({{1}}, 2) , {}));",pass,"to analyze the provided c++ code and the assertion statement, let's break down the function `get_row` and the assertion itself.

### function analysis
the function `get_row` takes two parameters:
1. a 2d vector `lst`, which represents a matrix where each row can have a different number of columns.
2. an integer `x`, which is the value we want to find in the matrix.

the function works as follows:
- it initializes an empty vector `out` to store the coordinates of the occurrences of `x`.
- it iterates through each row of the matrix using the outer loop (`for (int i=0; i<lst.size(); i++)`).
- for each row, it iterates through the columns in reverse order (`for (int j=lst[i].size()-1; j>=0; j-=1)`).
- if the current element `lst[i][j]` is equal to `x`, it adds the coordinate `{i, j}` to the `out` vector.
- finally, it returns the `out` vector.

### assertion analysis
the assertion statement is:
```cpp
assert (issame(get_row({{1}}, 2) , {}));
```

let's break this down:
- the input to `get_row` is a 2d vector `{{1}}`, which represents a single row with one element, `1`.
- the integer `x` is `2`.
- we need to check if `get_row({{1}}, 2)` returns an empty vector `{}`.

### execution of `get_row({{1}}, 2)`
1. the function initializes `out` as an empty vector.
2. it enters the outer loop with `i = 0` (the first and only row).
3. the inner loop starts with `j = 0` (the only column in the row).
4. it checks if `lst[0][0]` (which is `1`) is equal to `2`. this condition is false.
5. since there are no more columns to check, the inner loop ends.
6. the outer loop also ends as there are no more rows.
7. the function returns the empty vector `out`, which is `{}`.

### conclusion
the assertion checks if `get_row({{1}}, 2)` returns an empty vector, which it does. therefore, the assertion passes.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(get_row({{}, {1}, {1, 2, 3}}, 3) , {{2, 2}}));",pass,"to analyze whether the provided assertion passes or fails, we need to understand the behavior of the `get_row` function and how it processes the input.

### step-by-step analysis:

1. **function purpose**: the function `get_row` takes a 2d vector `lst` and an integer `x`. it searches for occurrences of `x` in the 2d vector and returns a vector of vectors containing the coordinates (row, column) of each occurrence. the coordinates are sorted by row in ascending order and by column in descending order.

2. **input for the assertion**: the assertion checks the output of the function with the input:
   ```cpp
   get_row({{}, {1}, {1, 2, 3}}, 3)
   ```
   here, `lst` is a 2d vector with three rows:
   - row 0: `{}`
   - row 1: `{1}`
   - row 2: `{1, 2, 3}`

   the integer `x` is `3`.

3. **function execution**:
   - the function initializes an empty output vector `out`.
   - it iterates over each row `i` of `lst`.
   - for each row, it iterates over the columns `j` in reverse order (from the last column to the first).
   - it checks if the element at `lst[i][j]` is equal to `x` (which is `3`).
   - if it finds a match, it adds the coordinate `{i, j}` to the output vector `out`.

4. **detailed iteration**:
   - for `i = 0`: `lst[0]` is `{}` (empty), so no columns to check.
   - for `i = 1`: `lst[1]` is `{1}`, which has no element equal to `3`, so no coordinates added.
   - for `i = 2`: `lst[2]` is `{1, 2, 3}`. the columns are checked in reverse:
     - `j = 2`: `lst[2][2]` is `3`, which matches `x`. the coordinate `{2, 2}` is added to `out`.
     - `j = 1`: `lst[2][1]` is `2`, which does not match `3`.
     - `j = 0`: `lst[2][0]` is `1`, which does not match `3`.

5. **final output**: after iterating through all rows and columns, the output vector `out` contains one coordinate: `{{2, 2}}`.

6. **assertion check**: the assertion checks if the output of `get_row({{}, {1}, {1, 2, 3}}, 3)` is equal to `{{2, 2}}`. since the function correctly identifies the coordinate of `3` in the input vector, the assertion will pass.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
