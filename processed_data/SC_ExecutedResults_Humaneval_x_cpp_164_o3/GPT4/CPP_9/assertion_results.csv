"assert (issame(rolling_max({}),{}));",pass,"to analyze the provided c/c++ code and the assertion statement, we need to understand the behavior of the `rolling_max` function when it is called with an empty vector.

### code analysis

1. **function purpose**: the function `rolling_max` is designed to take a vector of integers and return a new vector that contains the rolling maximum values up to each index in the input vector.

2. **initialization**: 
   - an empty vector `out` is initialized to store the results.
   - an integer `max` is initialized to `0`.

3. **loop through input**: the function iterates over each element in the input vector `numbers`:
   - if the current element `numbers[i]` is greater than `max`, it updates `max` to that element.
   - it then appends the current value of `max` to the `out` vector.

4. **return value**: finally, the function returns the `out` vector.

### assertion analysis

the assertion being tested is:
```cpp
assert (issame(rolling_max({}),{}));
```
this assertion checks if the result of `rolling_max` when called with an empty vector (`{}`) is the same as another empty vector (`{}`).

- **input**: an empty vector `numbers = {}`.
- **execution**:
  - the loop `for (int i=0;i<numbers.size();i++)` will not execute because `numbers.size()` is `0`.
  - therefore, the `out` vector remains empty.
- **return value**: the function will return an empty vector `out = {}`.

### comparison with expected output

the assertion checks if the result of `rolling_max({})` (which is `out = {}`) is the same as `{}`. since both are empty vectors, they are indeed the same.

### final result

based on the analysis, the assertion will pass because the output of the function matches the expected output.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(rolling_max({1, 2, 3, 4}) , {1, 2, 3, 4}));",pass,"to analyze the provided c++ code and the assertion statement, we need to understand how the `rolling_max` function works and whether it produces the expected output for the given input.

### code analysis

1. **function purpose**: the `rolling_max` function takes a vector of integers and returns a new vector where each element at index `i` is the maximum value found in the input vector from the start up to index `i`.

2. **initialization**: 
   - the function initializes an empty vector `out` to store the rolling maximum values.
   - it also initializes an integer `max` to 0, which will be used to keep track of the maximum value encountered so far.

3. **loop through input**: 
   - the function iterates through each element of the input vector `numbers`.
   - for each element, it checks if the current element `numbers[i]` is greater than `max`. if it is, `max` is updated to `numbers[i]`.
   - the current value of `max` is then pushed into the `out` vector.

4. **return value**: after the loop, the function returns the `out` vector containing the rolling maximum values.

### input for assertion
the assertion statement is:
```cpp
assert (issame(rolling_max({1, 2, 3, 4}) , {1, 2, 3, 4}));
```

### expected output
- for the input `{1, 2, 3, 4}`, the rolling maximums should be:
  - at index 0: max = 1 (output: 1)
  - at index 1: max = 2 (output: 2)
  - at index 2: max = 3 (output: 3)
  - at index 3: max = 4 (output: 4)

thus, the expected output of `rolling_max({1, 2, 3, 4})` is `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.

### assertion check
now we need to check if the output of `rolling_max({1, 2, 3, 4})` matches the expected output `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.

1. the function will produce the output `{1, 2, 3, 4}` as reasoned above.
2. the assertion checks if this output is the same as `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.

since both outputs are identical, the assertion will pass.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(rolling_max({4, 3, 2, 1}),{4, 4, 4, 4}));",pass,"to analyze the assertion statement provided, we need to evaluate the function `rolling_max` with the input `{4, 3, 2, 1}` and determine if the output matches the expected output `{4, 4, 4, 4}`.

### step-by-step analysis:

1. **understanding the function**: 
   - the function `rolling_max` takes a vector of integers as input and generates a new vector that contains the maximum value found in the input vector up to each index.
   - it initializes a variable `max` to `0` and iterates through each element of the input vector `numbers`.
   - for each element, it checks if the current element is greater than `max`. if it is, `max` is updated to the current element.
   - the current value of `max` is then pushed into the output vector `out`.

2. **input analysis**:
   - the input vector is `{4, 3, 2, 1}`.
   - we will track the value of `max` and the output vector `out` as we iterate through the input.

3. **iteration breakdown**:
   - **iteration 0** (`i = 0`):
     - current number: `4`
     - `max` is `0`, and `4 > 0`, so `max` becomes `4`.
     - output vector `out` becomes `{4}`.
   - **iteration 1** (`i = 1`):
     - current number: `3`
     - `max` is `4`, and `3` is not greater than `4`, so `max` remains `4`.
     - output vector `out` becomes `{4, 4}`.
   - **iteration 2** (`i = 2`):
     - current number: `2`
     - `max` is `4`, and `2` is not greater than `4`, so `max` remains `4`.
     - output vector `out` becomes `{4, 4, 4}`.
   - **iteration 3** (`i = 3`):
     - current number: `1`
     - `max` is `4`, and `1` is not greater than `4`, so `max` remains `4`.
     - output vector `out` becomes `{4, 4, 4, 4}`.

4. **final output**:
   - after processing all elements, the final output vector is `{4, 4, 4, 4}`.

5. **assertion evaluation**:
   - the assertion checks if the output of `rolling_max({4, 3, 2, 1})` is equal to `{4, 4, 4, 4}`.
   - since we determined that the output is indeed `{4, 4, 4, 4}`, the assertion passes.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(rolling_max({3, 2, 3, 100, 3}) ,{3, 3, 3, 100, 100}));",pass,"to analyze whether the provided assertion passes or fails, we need to understand how the `rolling_max` function works and what the expected output is for the input `{3, 2, 3, 100, 3}`.

### step-by-step analysis of the function

1. **initialization**: 
   - the function initializes an empty vector `out` to store the rolling maximum values.
   - it also initializes an integer `max` to 0.

2. **iterating through the input vector**:
   - the function iterates through each element of the input vector `numbers`.

3. **updating the maximum**:
   - for each element `numbers[i]`, it checks if `numbers[i]` is greater than `max`.
   - if it is, it updates `max` to `numbers[i]`.

4. **storing the maximum**:
   - after checking (and possibly updating) `max`, it pushes the current value of `max` into the output vector `out`.

### input analysis
now let's analyze the input `{3, 2, 3, 100, 3}` step by step:

- **iteration 0** (`i = 0`):
  - `numbers[0] = 3`
  - `max` is updated to `3` (since `3 > 0`).
  - `out` becomes `{3}`.

- **iteration 1** (`i = 1`):
  - `numbers[1] = 2`
  - `max` remains `3` (since `2 < 3`).
  - `out` becomes `{3, 3}`.

- **iteration 2** (`i = 2`):
  - `numbers[2] = 3`
  - `max` remains `3` (since `3 = 3`).
  - `out` becomes `{3, 3, 3}`.

- **iteration 3** (`i = 3`):
  - `numbers[3] = 100`
  - `max` is updated to `100` (since `100 > 3`).
  - `out` becomes `{3, 3, 3, 100}`.

- **iteration 4** (`i = 4`):
  - `numbers[4] = 3`
  - `max` remains `100` (since `3 < 100`).
  - `out` becomes `{3, 3, 3, 100, 100}`.

### final output
the final output of the function `rolling_max({3, 2, 3, 100, 3})` is `{3, 3, 3, 100, 100}`.

### assertion analysis
the assertion checks if the output of `rolling_max({3, 2, 3, 100, 3})` is the same as `{3, 3, 3, 100, 100}`. since we have determined that the output is indeed `{3, 3, 3, 100, 100}`, the assertion will pass.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
