1. the `exchange` function takes two vectors of integers as input.
2. it iterates through both vectors and counts the number of even elements in both vectors.
3. if the total count of even elements is greater than or equal to the size of the first vector, it returns ""yes"", indicating that it is possible to make all elements of the first vector even by exchanging elements with the second vector.
4. otherwise, it returns ""no"".

"assert (exchange({5, 7, 3}, {2, 6, 4}) == ""YES"");",pass,"### thinking process
1. the function `exchange` takes two vectors of integers as input and checks if it is possible to exchange elements between the two vectors to make all elements of the first vector even.
2. it counts the number of even elements in both vectors and if the total count is greater than or equal to the size of the first vector, it returns ""yes"", otherwise ""no"".
3. the provided assertion checks if it is possible to exchange elements between `{5, 7, 3}` and `{2, 6, 4}` to make all elements of the first vector even.

1. the `exchange` function takes two vectors of integers as input.
2. it iterates through both vectors and counts the number of even numbers in each vector.
3. if the total count of even numbers in both vectors is greater than or equal to the size of `lst1`, it returns ""yes"", indicating that it is possible to make all elements of `lst1` even by exchanging elements with `lst2`.
4. otherwise, it returns ""no"".
