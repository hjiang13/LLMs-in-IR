1. the `common` function takes two vectors as input and returns a vector containing the sorted unique common elements between the two input vectors.
2. the function iterates over the elements of the first vector `l1`, checks if the element is not already in the `out` vector, and if it exists in the second vector `l2`, then adds it to the `out` vector.
3. finally, the `out` vector is sorted and returned.
4. the assertion statement compares the output of the `common` function with the expected vector `{1, 5, 653}`.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"

2. the function iterates through the elements of the first vector (`l1`) and checks if the element is not already in the `out` vector and if it exists in the second vector (`l2`).
3. if the conditions are met, the element is added to the `out` vector.
4. the `out` vector is then sorted before being returned.
