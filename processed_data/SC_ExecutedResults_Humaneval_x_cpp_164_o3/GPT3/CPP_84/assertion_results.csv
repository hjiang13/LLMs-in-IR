"assert (solve(1000) == ""1"");",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `solve` function takes a positive integer `n` as input and calculates the sum of its digits in binary.
2. it converts the integer `n` to a string, then iterates over each character in the string to calculate the sum of digits.
3. it then converts the sum to binary by repeatedly dividing by 2 and storing the remainder.
4. the final binary string is returned as the output.

2. it converts the integer `n` to a string, then iterates through each character in the string to calculate the sum of digits.
3. after calculating the sum, it converts the sum to binary by repeatedly dividing by 2 and storing the remainder.
4. the binary representation is stored in the string `bi` and returned as the output.
