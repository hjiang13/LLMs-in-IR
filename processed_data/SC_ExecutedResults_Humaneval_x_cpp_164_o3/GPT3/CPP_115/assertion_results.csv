"assert (max_fill({{0,0,1,0}, {0,1,0,0}, {1,1,1,1}}, 1) == 6);",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `max_fill` function takes a 2d vector `grid` representing the wells and an integer `capacity` representing the bucket capacity.
2. it iterates over each row of the grid, calculates the total water units in each well, and then calculates the number of times the bucket needs to be lowered to empty the well based on the capacity.
3. the total number of times the bucket needs to be lowered for all wells is returned as the output.

### assertion result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
