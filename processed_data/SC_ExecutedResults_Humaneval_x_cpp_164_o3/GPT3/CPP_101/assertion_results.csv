1. the given c++ code defines a function `words_string` that takes a string as input and splits the string into words based on spaces or commas.
2. it initializes an empty string `current` to store the current word being processed and an empty vector `out` to store the final list of words.
3. it iterates over each character in the input string, checks if it's a space or comma, and if so, adds the current word to the `out` vector and resets the `current` string.
4. finally, it returns the vector of words.

2. it initializes an empty string `current` to store the current word being processed and an empty vector `out` to store the final words.
3. it iterates through the input string character by character, checking for spaces or commas to split the words.
4. when a space or comma is encountered, it adds the current word to the `out` vector and resets the `current` string.
5. finally, it returns the vector of words.
6. the assertion statement tests the function with a specific input and checks if the output matches the expected vector of words.
