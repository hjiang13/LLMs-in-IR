assert (largest_divisor(3) == 1);,pass,"### thinking process
1. the `largest_divisor` function takes an integer `n` as input and finds the largest number that divides `n` evenly, smaller than `n`.
2. the function starts checking from `i=2` up to the square root of `n`.
3. if `n` is divisible by `i`, it returns `n/i` which is the largest divisor smaller than `n`.
4. if no divisor is found, it returns 1.

1. the `largest_divisor` function takes an integer `n` as input and finds the largest number that divides `n` evenly, smaller than `n`.
2. the function starts checking from `i=2` up to the square root of `n`. if `n` is divisible by `i`, it returns `n/i`.
3. if no divisor is found, the function returns 1.
4. the assertion statement `assert (largest_divisor(7) == 1)` checks if the largest divisor of 7 is 1.

assert (largest_divisor(10) == 5);,fail,"### thinking process
1. the `largest_divisor` function takes an integer `n` as input and finds the largest number that divides `n` evenly, smaller than `n`.
2. the function iterates from `2` to the square root of `n` and checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. if it is, it returns `n/i`, which is the largest divisor smaller than `n`.
3. if no divisor is found in the loop, the function returns `1`.
4. the assertion statement `assert (largest_divisor(10) == 5);` checks if the largest divisor of `10` is `5`.

1. the `largest_divisor` function takes an integer `n` as input and finds the largest number that divides `n` evenly, smaller than `n`.
2. the function iterates from `2` to the square root of `n` and checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. if it is, it returns `n/i` as the largest divisor.
3. if no divisor is found in the loop, it returns `1`.
4. the assertion statement checks if calling `largest_divisor(100)` returns `50`.
