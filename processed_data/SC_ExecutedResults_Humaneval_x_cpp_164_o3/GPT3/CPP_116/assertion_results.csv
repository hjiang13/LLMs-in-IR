1. the `sort_array` function takes a vector of integers and sorts them based on the number of ones in their binary representation in ascending order. if the number of ones is the same, it sorts based on the decimal value.
2. the function calculates the number of ones in the binary representation of each number and stores it in a separate vector `bin`.
3. it then sorts the input vector `arr` based on the values in the `bin` vector.
4. the assertion statement is comparing the sorted output of the function with the expected sorted vector `{1, 2, 4, 3, 5}`.

### assertion result
- **assertion result**: **fail** 

### explanation
the provided assertion fails because the `sort_array` function does not handle negative numbers correctly. it calculates the number of ones in the binary representation of the absolute value of the input numbers, which leads to incorrect sorting for negative numbers. the assertion fails because the sorting of the input vector `{2, 4, 8, 16, 32}` is not as expected due to the incorrect handling of negative numbers."
