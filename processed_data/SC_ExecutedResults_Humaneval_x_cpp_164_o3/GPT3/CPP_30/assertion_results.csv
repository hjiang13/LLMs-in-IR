1. the `get_positive` function takes a vector of floats as input and returns a new vector containing only the positive numbers from the input vector.
2. the function iterates through the input vector and checks if each element is greater than 0. if it is, the element is added to the output vector.
3. the assertion statement is comparing the output of the `get_positive` function with the expected vector `{4, 5, 6}` for the input vector `{-1, -2, 4, 5, 6}`.

### final result

1. the `get_positive` function takes a vector of floats as input and returns a new vector containing only the positive numbers.
2. the assertion statement is checking if calling `get_positive` with input `{-1, -2}` returns an empty vector `{}`.
3. since both -1 and -2 are negative numbers, the output should be an empty vector.
