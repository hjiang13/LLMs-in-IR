1. the `minpath` function takes a grid and an integer `k` as input and returns an ordered vector of values on the cells that the minimum path goes through.
2. the function first finds the starting cell with value 1 in the grid.
3. then, it calculates the minimum value among the neighboring cells of the starting cell.
4. it constructs the output vector based on the value of `k`, alternating between 1 and the minimum value.
