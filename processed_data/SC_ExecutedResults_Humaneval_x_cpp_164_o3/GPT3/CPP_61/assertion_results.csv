"assert (correct_bracketing(""()""));",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `correct_bracketing` function takes a string of brackets as input and checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.
2. it iterates through the string and increments the `level` variable for each opening bracket and decrements it for each closing bracket.
3. if the `level` becomes negative at any point or is not zero at the end, it returns false indicating incorrect bracketing.
4. if the `level` remains zero till the end, it returns true indicating correct bracketing.

1. the `correct_bracketing` function takes a string of brackets as input and checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.
2. it uses a `level` variable to keep track of the balance of brackets. it increments the `level` when an opening bracket is encountered and decrements it when a closing bracket is encountered.
3. if at any point the `level` becomes negative, it means there are more closing brackets than opening brackets, so it returns false.
4. at the end, if the `level` is not zero, it means there are unmatched brackets, so it returns false.
5. otherwise, it returns true.

1. the `correct_bracketing` function takes a string of brackets as input and checks if the brackets are correctly matched.
2. it uses a variable `level` to keep track of the balance of opening and closing brackets.
