"assert (issame(tri(3) , {1, 3, 2, 8}));",pass,"### thinking process
1. the given c++ code defines a function `tri` that calculates the tribonacci sequence based on the provided recurrence relation.
2. the function takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns a vector of the first `n + 1` numbers of the tribonacci sequence.
3. the function initializes the vector `out` with the first two elements of the sequence (1 and 3).
4. it then iterates from index 2 to `n` and calculates the next element based on whether the index is even or odd.
5. for even indices, it calculates the element as `1 + i/2`.
6. for odd indices, it calculates the element as the sum of the previous three elements in the sequence.
7. the function returns the vector of tribonacci sequence elements.
