"assert (valid_date(""03-11-2000"") == true);",pass,"### thinking process
1. the function `valid_date` takes a string as input, representing a date in the format mm-dd-yyyy.
2. the function first checks if the length of the input string is 10 characters.
3. it then iterates through the string to ensure that the format is correct (mm-dd-yyyy) and that the characters at positions 2 and 5 are '-'.
4. it extracts the month, day, and year from the string using `substr` and `atoi` functions.
5. it checks if the month is between 1 and 12, and if the day is within the valid range based on the month.
6. if the day is 31 and the month is april, june, september, november, or february, it returns false. if the day is 30 and the month is february, it returns false.
7. finally, it returns true if all conditions are satisfied.
