"assert (choose_num(12, 15) == 14);",pass,"### thinking process
1. the function `choose_num` takes two positive integers `x` and `y` as input.
2. it checks if `y` is less than `x`, then it returns -1.
3. if `y` is equal to `x` and `y` is odd, it returns -1.
4. if `y` is odd, it returns `y-1`.
5. otherwise, it returns `y`.

1. the function `choose_num` takes two positive numbers `x` and `y` and returns the biggest even integer number in the range `[x, y]` inclusive.
2. if `y` is less than `x`, the function should return -1.
3. if `y` is equal to `x` and `y` is odd, the function should return -1.
4. if `y` is odd, the function should return `y-1`.
