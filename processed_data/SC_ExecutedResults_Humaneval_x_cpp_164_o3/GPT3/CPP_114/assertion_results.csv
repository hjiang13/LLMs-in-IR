"assert (minSubArraySum({2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4}) == 1);",pass,"### thinking process
1. the given function `minsubarraysum` takes a vector of integers as input and finds the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-vector of the input vector.
2. the function initializes two variables `current` and `min` to the first element of the input vector.
3. it then iterates through the vector, updating the `current` sum based on whether it is negative or positive.
4. it also updates the `min` value if the `current` sum is less than the current `min`.
5. finally, it returns the minimum sum found.
6. we need to analyze whether the function correctly calculates the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-vector.
