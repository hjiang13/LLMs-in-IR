1. the function `count_upper` takes a string `s` as input and counts the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
2. it initializes a string `uvowel` with uppercase vowels ""aeiou"" and a counter `count` to 0.
3. it iterates through the string `s` at even indices (i*2) and checks if the character at that index is an uppercase vowel.
4. if the character is an uppercase vowel, it increments the counter `count`.
5. finally, it returns the count of uppercase vowels in even indices.

1. the function `count_upper` takes a string `s` as input and counts the number of uppercase vowels in even indices of the string.
2. it initializes a string `uvowel` with uppercase vowels ""aeiou"" and a count variable to 0.
3. it then iterates over the string `s` at even indices (i*2) and checks if the character at that index is an uppercase vowel.
4. if the character is an uppercase vowel, it increments the count.

1. the `count_upper` function takes a string `s` as input and counts the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
2. it initializes a string `uvowel` with uppercase vowels ""aeiou"" and a counter `count` to keep track of the number of uppercase vowels found.
3. it iterates through the string `s` by incrementing `i` by 2 in each iteration to access even indices.
4. for each character at even index `i*2`, it checks if it is an uppercase vowel by using `find` function from the algorithm library.
5. if the character is found in `uvowel`, it increments the `count`.
6. finally, it returns the total count of uppercase vowels found in even indices of the input string.

1. the function `count_upper` takes a string as input and counts the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
2. it initializes a count variable to 0 and iterates through the string at every even index.
3. if the character at the even index is an uppercase vowel (a, e, i, o, u), it increments the count.
4. finally, it returns the count of uppercase vowels at even indices.
