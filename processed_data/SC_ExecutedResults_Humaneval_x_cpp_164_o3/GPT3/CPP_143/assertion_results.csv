"assert (words_in_sentence(""This is a test"") == ""is"");",pass,"### thinking process
1. the function `words_in_sentence` takes a string as input, splits the string into words, and returns only the words whose lengths are prime numbers.
2. the function iterates through each character in the input string, builds a word until it reaches a space, then checks if the length of the word is a prime number.
3. if the length of the word is a prime number, it adds the word to the output string.
4. the function then removes the extra space at the end and returns the final output string.

1. the function `words_in_sentence` takes a string `sentence` as input and returns a string containing words from the original sentence whose lengths are prime numbers.
2. the function loops through the input sentence, extracts words, checks if the length of the word is a prime number, and adds it to the output string if it is.
3. the function then returns the final output string.

1. the `words_in_sentence` function takes a string as input, splits the string into words, and returns only the words whose lengths are prime numbers.
2. the function iterates through each character in the input string, builds a word until it reaches a space character, then checks if the length of the word is a prime number.
3. if the length of the word is a prime number, it adds the word to the output string.
4. finally, it returns the output string containing only words with prime lengths.

1. the function `words_in_sentence` takes a string as input and returns a new string containing only the words whose lengths are prime numbers.
2. the function loops through each character in the input sentence, builds a word until it encounters a space, then checks if the length of the word is a prime number.
3. if the length of the word is a prime number, it is added to the output string.
4. the function then removes the extra space at the end of the output string before returning it.
