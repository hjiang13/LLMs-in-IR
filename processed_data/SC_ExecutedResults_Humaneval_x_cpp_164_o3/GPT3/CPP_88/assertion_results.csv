"assert (issame(sort_array({}) , {}));",pass,"### thinking process
1. the function `sort_array` takes a vector of non-negative integers and returns a sorted copy of the vector based on the sum of the first and last elements.
2. if the sum of the first and last elements is odd, the vector is sorted in ascending order.
3. if the sum of the first and last elements is even, the vector is sorted in descending order.
4. the function handles empty vectors by returning an empty vector.
5. the function first sorts the vector in ascending order and then reverses it if needed.

1. the given function `sort_array` takes a vector of integers as input and returns a sorted copy of the vector based on the sum of the first and last elements.
2. if the sum of the first and last elements is odd, the vector is sorted in ascending order. if it is even, the vector is sorted in descending order.
3. the function first checks if the input vector is empty and returns an empty vector in that case.
4. it then checks the sum of the first and last elements to determine the sorting order.
5. if the sum is odd, it sorts the vector in ascending order using `sort` function.
6. if the sum is even, it also sorts the vector in ascending order and then creates a new vector in descending order by iterating from the end of the sorted vector.

1. the function `sort_array` takes a vector of integers as input and returns a sorted copy of the vector based on the sum of the first and last elements.
2. if the sum of the first and last elements is odd, the vector is sorted in ascending order. if it's even, the vector is sorted in descending order.
3. the code first checks if the input vector is empty and returns an empty vector if it is.
4. it then checks the sum of the first and last elements to determine the sorting order.
5. if the sum is odd, it sorts the vector in ascending order using `sort(array.begin(), array.end())`.
6. if the sum is even, it also sorts the vector in ascending order but then creates a new vector in reverse order.
7. the assertion statement checks if the output of `sort_array({2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6})` matches the expected vector `{6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0}`.
