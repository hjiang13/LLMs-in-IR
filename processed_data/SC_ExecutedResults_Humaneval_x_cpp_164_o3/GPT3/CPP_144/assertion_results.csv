"assert (simplify(""1/5"", ""5/1"") == true);",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `simplify` function takes two string arguments representing fractions.
2. it extracts the numerator and denominator from both fractions.
3. it multiplies the numerators and denominators of the two fractions.
4. it checks if the result is a whole number by checking if the remainder of the division is 0.
5. returns true if the result is a whole number, otherwise false.

1. the `simplify` function takes two string inputs representing fractions in the format `<numerator>/<denominator>`.
2. it extracts the numerator and denominator from both fractions and performs the multiplication.
3. it checks if the result is a whole number by checking if the product of numerators modulo the product of denominators is zero.
4. if the result is a whole number, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
