"assert (right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == true);",pass,"### thinking process
1. the given function `right_angle_triangle` takes in three float values representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle.
2. the function checks if the triangle formed by these sides is a right-angled triangle by using the pythagorean theorem.
3. it calculates whether any of the three combinations of sides satisfy the pythagorean theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2).
4. if any of the combinations satisfy the condition within a small tolerance (1e-4), it returns true, indicating a right-angled triangle.
5. otherwise, it returns false.
