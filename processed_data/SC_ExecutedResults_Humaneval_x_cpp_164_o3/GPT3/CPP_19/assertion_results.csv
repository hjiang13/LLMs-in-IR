"assert (sort_numbers("""") == """");",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `sort_numbers` function takes a space-delimited string of numerals from ""zero"" to ""nine"" and returns the string with numbers sorted from smallest to largest.
2. the function uses two maps to convert strings to integers and vice versa for the numbers.
3. it then counts the occurrences of each number in the input string and constructs the output string by appending the numbers in sorted order.
4. the output string is returned after removing the extra space at the end.

1. the `sort_numbers` function takes a space-delimited string of numbers in words and sorts them in ascending order.
2. the function uses two maps to convert words to numbers and vice versa.
3. it then counts the occurrences of each number in the input string and constructs the output string in sorted order.
4. the assertion statement is checking if the function correctly sorts the input string ""three"" to ""three"".

1. the `sort_numbers` function takes a space-delimited string of numbers in words and sorts them from smallest to largest.
2. it uses two maps to convert words to numbers and vice versa.
3. it counts the occurrences of each number and reconstructs the sorted string.
4. the assertion statement compares the output of `sort_numbers(""three five nine"")` with the expected result `""three five nine""`.
