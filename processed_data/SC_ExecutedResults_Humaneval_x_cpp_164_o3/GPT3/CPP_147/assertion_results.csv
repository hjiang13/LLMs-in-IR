assert (get_matrix_triples(5) == 1);,pass,"### thinking process
1. the given code defines a function `get_matrix_triples` that takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns the number of triples (a{i}, a{j}, a{k}) of a where i < j < k, and a[i] + a[j] + a[k] is a multiple of 3.
2. the function creates a vector `a` of length `n` where each element is calculated as `i * i - i + 1`.
3. it then uses two-dimensional vectors `sum` and `sum2` to keep track of the counts of remainders when divided by 3.
4. the function iterates over the elements of `a` and updates the counts in `sum` and `sum2`.
5. finally, it returns the count of triples where the sum is a multiple of 3.

1. the given code defines a function `get_matrix_triples` that takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns the number of triples in the vector `a` where the sum of the elements in the triple is a multiple of 3.
2. the function calculates the values of the vector `a` based on the formula `a{i} = i * i - i + 1`.
3. it then uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of triples that sum to a multiple of 3.
4. the code seems to be calculating the number of triples correctly, but we need to verify if the assertion for `n=6` is correct.

1. the given code defines a function `get_matrix_triples` that takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns the number of triples `(a{i}, a{j}, a{k})` where `i < j < k` and `a[i] + a[j] + a[k]` is a multiple of 3.
2. the function calculates the values of the vector `a` based on the formula `a{i} = i * i - i + 1`.
3. it then uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of triples that sum up to a multiple of 3.
4. the code seems to be calculating the number of triples correctly based on the given formula.

2. the function calculates the values of the vector `a` based on the formula `a{i} = i * i - i + 1`.
3. it then calculates the number of valid triples by keeping track of the sums of elements modulo 3 in the `sum` vector.
4. the function iterates over the values of `n` and computes the result.
5. the assertion statement checks if the result of `get_matrix_triples(100)` is equal to 53361.
