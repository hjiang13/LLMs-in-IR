assert (is_multiply_prime(5) == false);,pass,"### thinking process
1. the `is_multiply_prime` function takes an integer as input and checks if it can be represented as the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.
2. the function iterates through numbers starting from 2 up to the square root of the input number.
3. it divides the input number by the current number in the loop if it is a factor, and increments a counter.
4. if the counter reaches 2, it means the number can be represented as the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.
5. the function returns true if the condition is met, otherwise false.

1. the `is_multiply_prime` function takes an integer `a` as input and checks if `a` can be expressed as the multiplication of exactly 3 prime numbers.
2. the function iterates through numbers starting from 2 up to the square root of `a` and checks if `a` is divisible by the current number.
3. if `a` is divisible by the current number, it divides `a` by that number and increments the count of prime factors.
4. if the count of prime factors is exactly 2, it means `a` can be expressed as the multiplication of 3 prime numbers and returns true, otherwise false.

1. the `is_multiply_prime` function takes an integer as input and checks if it can be represented as the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.
2. the function loops through all numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number.
3. it checks if the input number is divisible by the current number in the loop and if it is greater than the current number.
4. if the input number is divisible by the current number, it divides the input number by that number and increments a counter.
5. if the counter reaches 2, it means the input number can be represented as the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.
