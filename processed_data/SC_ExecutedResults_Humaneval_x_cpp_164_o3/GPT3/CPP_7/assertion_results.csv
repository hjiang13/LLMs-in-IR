"assert (issame(filter_by_substring({}, ""john""),{}));",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `filter_by_substring` function takes in a vector of strings and a substring to filter the strings by.
2. it iterates through each string in the input vector and checks if the substring is present in the string using the `find` function.
3. if the substring is found in the string, it adds the string to the output vector.
4. the function returns the output vector containing only the strings that contain the given substring.

1. the `filter_by_substring` function takes a vector of strings and a substring as input.
2. it filters the input vector by only keeping the strings that contain the given substring.
3. the function uses the `find` method of the `string` class to check if the substring is present in each string.
4. if the substring is found in a string, that string is added to the output vector.
5. the function returns the filtered vector of strings.

1. the `filter_by_substring` function takes a vector of strings and a substring as input.
2. it filters the input vector of strings to only include those that contain the given substring.
3. the function uses the `find` method of the `string` class to check if the substring exists in each string.
4. if the substring is found in a string, that string is added to the output vector.
5. the function returns the filtered vector of strings.
