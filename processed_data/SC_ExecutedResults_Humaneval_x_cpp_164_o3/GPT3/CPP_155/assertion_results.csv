"assert (issame(even_odd_count(7) , {0, 1}));",pass,"### thinking process
1. the given c/c++ code defines a function `even_odd_count` that takes an integer as input and returns a vector containing the count of even and odd digits in the input number.
2. the function first converts the absolute value of the input number to a string.
3. it then iterates over each character in the string and increments the count of even or odd digits accordingly.
4. finally, it returns a vector containing the count of even and odd digits.
5. the assertion statement calls the `even_odd_count` function with the input `7` and checks if the returned vector is `{0, 1}`.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"

1. the `even_odd_count` function takes an integer as input and returns a vector containing the count of even and odd digits in the absolute value of the input number.
2. the function converts the absolute value of the input number to a string and then iterates through each character to determine if it is even or odd.
3. it increments the count of even digits if the character is even (divisible by 2) and increments the count of odd digits if the character is odd.
4. finally, it returns a vector containing the count of even and odd digits.

1. the `even_odd_count` function takes an integer as input and returns a vector with the count of even and odd digits in the number.
2. the function first converts the absolute value of the input number to a string.
3. it then iterates through each character in the string and counts the number of even and odd digits.
4. if the digit is odd (remainder when divided by 2 is 1), it increments the odd count, otherwise, it increments the even count.
5. finally, it returns a vector with the counts of even and odd digits.

4. if the digit is odd (i.e., not divisible by 2), it increments the odd count, otherwise, it increments the even count.
5. finally, it returns a vector containing the even count followed by the odd count.

1. the given c/c++ code defines a function `even_odd_count` that takes an integer as input and returns a vector containing the count of even and odd digits in the absolute value of the input number.
2. the function first converts the absolute value of the input number to a string using `to_string` function.
3. it then iterates through each character in the string and checks if the digit is odd or even by checking if `w[i] % 2 == 1`.
4. based on the check, it increments the count of odd or even digits.
