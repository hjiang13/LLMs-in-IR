"assert (count_distinct_characters("""") == 0);",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `count_distinct_characters` function takes a string as input and returns the count of distinct characters in the string, regardless of case.
2. the function converts the input string to lowercase using the `transform` function.
3. it then iterates through each character in the string and checks if it is already present in the `distinct` vector. if not, it adds the character to the vector.
4. finally, the function returns the size of the `distinct` vector, which represents the count of distinct characters in the input string.
5. the assertion statement checks if the function returns 0 when an empty string is passed as input.

### final result

1. the `count_distinct_characters` function takes a string as input and returns the count of distinct characters in the string (ignoring case).
2. the function converts the input string to lowercase using `transform` and then iterates through each character to check if it is already in the `distinct` vector.
3. if the character is not found in the `distinct` vector, it is added to the vector.
4. finally, the function returns the size of the `distinct` vector, which represents the count of distinct characters in the input string.

1. the `count_distinct_characters` function takes a string as input and returns the count of distinct characters in the string (case-insensitive).
2. the function converts the input string to lowercase using the `transform` function.
3. it then iterates over each character in the lowercase string and checks if it is already present in the `distinct` vector. if not, it adds the character to the `distinct` vector.
4. finally, the function returns the size of the `distinct` vector, which represents the count of distinct characters in the input string.

1. the `count_distinct_characters` function takes a string as input and counts the number of distinct characters in the string, ignoring case.
2. it converts the input string to lowercase using `transform` function.
3. it then iterates through each character in the string and checks if it is already present in the `distinct` vector. if not present, it adds the character to the vector.
4. finally, it returns the size of the `distinct` vector, which represents the count of distinct characters in the input string.
5. the assertion statement is checking if the function correctly counts the distinct characters in the input string ""jerry jerry jerrry"" (which should be 5).
