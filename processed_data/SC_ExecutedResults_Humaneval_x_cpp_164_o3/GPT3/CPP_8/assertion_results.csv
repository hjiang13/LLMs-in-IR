"assert (issame(sum_product({}) ,{0, 1}));",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `sum_product` function takes a vector of integers as input and calculates the sum and product of all the integers in the vector.
2. the function initializes `sum` to 0 and `product` to 1.
3. it then iterates through the vector, updating `sum` and `product` accordingly.
4. finally, it returns a vector containing the sum and product.

"assert (issame(sum_product({100, 0}),{100, 0}));",fail,"### thinking process
1. the `sum_product` function takes a vector of integers as input and returns a vector containing the sum and product of all the integers in the input vector.
2. the function iterates through the input vector, calculates the sum and product of the integers, and returns a vector containing these values.
3. the assertion statement is comparing the output of the `sum_product` function when called with `{100, 0}` to the expected vector `{100, 0}`.

1. the `sum_product` function takes a vector of integers as input and calculates the sum and product of all the integers in the vector.
2. the function iterates through the vector, updating the sum and product variables accordingly.
3. the function returns a vector containing the sum and product.
4. the assertion statement checks if the result of `sum_product({3, 5, 7})` is equal to `{3 + 5 + 7, 3 * 5 * 7}`.

"assert (issame(sum_product({10}) ,{10, 10}));",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `sum_product` function takes a vector of integers as input and returns a vector containing the sum and product of all the integers in the input vector.
2. the assertion statement is checking if the output of `sum_product({10})` is equal to `{10, 10}`.
3. when the input vector is `{10}`, the sum should be `10` and the product should also be `10`.
4. therefore, the assertion should pass if the function is implemented correctly.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
