1. the `rounded_avg` function takes two integers `n` and `m` and calculates the average of the integers from `n` through `m`, rounds it to the nearest integer, converts it to binary, and returns the result as a string.
2. if `n` is greater than `m`, the function returns ""-1"".
3. the function calculates the average of `n` and `m`, converts it to binary, and returns the binary representation as a string.

2. if `n` is greater than `m`, the function returns ""-1"".
3. the average is calculated by `(m+n)/2`.

1. the function `rounded_avg` takes two positive integers `n` and `m` as input and calculates the average of integers from `n` through `m`.
2. if `n` is greater than `m`, the function returns ""-1"".
3. the average is calculated as `(m + n) / 2`.
4. the average is then converted to binary by repeatedly dividing by 2 and storing the remainders.
5. the binary representation is constructed by concatenating the remainders in reverse order.

### assertion result
- **assertion result**: **fail** 

### explanation
- for the assertion `rounded_avg(5, 5)`, the expected binary representation of the average of 5 is ""101"".
- however, the actual output of the function `rounded_avg(5, 5)` is ""10"" which is the binary representation of the average of 5 rounded down.
- therefore, the assertion fails."
