"assert (is_simple_power(1, 4)== true);",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `is_simple_power` function takes two integers `x` and `n` as input and checks if `x` is a simple power of `n`.
2. it initializes `p` to 1 and a count variable to keep track of the number of iterations.
3. it then enters a while loop where it multiplies `p` by `n` until `p` is greater than `x` or the count reaches 100.
4. if `p` becomes equal to `x` at any point, it returns true, indicating that `x` is a simple power of `n`.
5. if the loop completes without finding a match, it returns false.
