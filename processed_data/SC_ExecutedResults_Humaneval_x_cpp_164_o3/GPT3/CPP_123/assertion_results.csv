"assert (issame(get_odd_collatz(14) , {1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17}));",fail,"### thinking process
1. we need to analyze the `get_odd_collatz` function to understand how it generates the odd numbers in the collatz sequence.
2. for the input `n`, the function starts with `1` in the output vector and then iterates through the collatz sequence until `n` becomes `1`.
3. if the current number `n` is odd, it is added to the output vector and updated as `n*3+1`, otherwise, it is updated as `n/2`.
4. finally, the output vector is sorted in increasing order before returning.

### assertion result
- **assertion result**: **fail**"
"assert (issame(get_odd_collatz(5) , {1, 5}));",pass,"### thinking process
1. the function `get_odd_collatz` takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns a sorted vector containing the odd numbers in the collatz sequence starting from `n`.
2. the function initializes the output vector with 1 and then iterates through the collatz sequence until `n` reaches 1, adding odd numbers to the output vector.
3. the output vector is sorted in increasing order before being returned.
4. for the given assertion, we need to check if the output of `get_odd_collatz(5)` matches the expected vector `{1, 5}`.

2. the function initializes the output vector with 1 and then iterates through the collatz sequence until `n` reaches 1.
3. if the current number is odd, it is added to the output vector, and the next number is calculated using the collatz rule.
4. finally, the output vector is sorted in increasing order before being returned.
