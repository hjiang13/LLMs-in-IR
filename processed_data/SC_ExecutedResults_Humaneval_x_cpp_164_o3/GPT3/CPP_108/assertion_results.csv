assert (count_nums({}) == 0);,pass,"### thinking process
1. the function `count_nums` takes a vector of integers as input.
2. it iterates through each element in the vector.
3. if the element is positive, it increments the `num` counter by 1.
4. if the element is negative, it calculates the sum of its digits and checks if the sum is greater than 0. if it is, it increments the `num` counter by 1.
5. the function returns the total count of elements that have a sum of digits greater than 0.

1. the `count_nums` function takes a vector of integers and counts the number of elements whose sum of digits is greater than 0.
2. for negative numbers, the function considers the sum of the absolute values of the digits.
3. the function iterates through the vector, calculates the sum of digits for each element, and increments the count if the sum is greater than 0.
4. the provided assertion checks if the function returns 0 for the input vector `{-1, -2, 0}`.
