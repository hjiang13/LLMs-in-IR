1. the `flip_case` function takes a string as input and flips the case of each character (lowercase to uppercase and vice versa).
2. the function iterates through each character in the input string and checks if it is a lowercase or uppercase character.
3. if the character is lowercase, it converts it to uppercase by subtracting 32 from its ascii value.
4. if the character is uppercase, it converts it to lowercase by adding 32 to its ascii value.
5. the function returns the modified string with flipped cases.
