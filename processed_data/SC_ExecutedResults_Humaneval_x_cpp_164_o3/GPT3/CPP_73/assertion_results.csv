"assert (smallest_change({1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6}) == 4);",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `smallest_change` function takes a vector of integers as input and calculates the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the vector palindromic.
2. the function iterates through the vector from the start and end simultaneously, comparing elements at corresponding positions.
3. if the elements at the current positions are not equal, it increments the `out` variable by 1.
4. the final value of `out` represents the minimum number of changes required to make the vector palindromic.

2. the function iterates through the vector from the beginning and end simultaneously, comparing elements.
3. if the elements at the corresponding positions are not equal, it increments the `out` variable, which keeps track of the number of changes needed.

1. the `smallest_change` function iterates through the vector from both ends towards the center.
2. it compares the elements at symmetric positions and increments the `out` counter if they are not equal.
