assert (decode_shift(encoded_str) == str);,pass,"### thinking process
1. the `encode_shift` function encodes a given string by shifting each character by 5 in the alphabet.
2. the `decode_shift` function decodes a string that was encoded using the `encode_shift` function by shifting each character back by 5 in the alphabet.
3. we need to check if the `decode_shift` function correctly decodes the encoded string back to the original string.

### assertion result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
