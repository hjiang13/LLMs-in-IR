"assert (prod_signs({1, 2, 2, -4}) == -9);",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `prod_signs` function takes a vector of integers as input and calculates the sum of the magnitudes of the integers multiplied by the product of all signs (1, -1, or 0) of each number in the vector.
2. if the input vector is empty, the function returns -32768.
3. the function iterates through the vector, calculates the sum of absolute values of integers, and updates the product of signs accordingly.
4. the final result is the product of signs multiplied by the sum of magnitudes.

1. the function `prod_signs` takes a vector of integers as input and calculates the sum of the magnitudes of the integers multiplied by the product of all signs of each number.
2. if the input vector is empty, the function should return -32768.
3. the function iterates through the vector, calculates the sum of magnitudes, and updates the product of signs accordingly.
4. the product of signs is initialized to 1, and it is updated based on the sign of each element in the vector.
5. the sum of magnitudes multiplied by the product of signs is returned as the result.
