1. the `digitsum` function takes a string as input and calculates the sum of the ascii values of the uppercase characters in the string.
2. the function iterates through each character in the string and checks if the ascii value falls within the range of uppercase characters (65 to 90).
3. if the character is an uppercase character, its ascii value is added to the `sum`.
4. finally, the function returns the total sum of ascii values of uppercase characters in the input string.

### assertion result
- **assertion result**: **fail** 

### explanation
- for the input string ""you are very smart"", the uppercase characters are 'y', 'e', 'v', 's'. their ascii values are 89, 69, 86, 83 respectively.
- the sum of these ascii values is 327.
- however, the `digitsum` function is not correctly summing up the ascii values of uppercase characters. it is directly adding the character values instead of their ascii values.
- hence, the assertion fails."
