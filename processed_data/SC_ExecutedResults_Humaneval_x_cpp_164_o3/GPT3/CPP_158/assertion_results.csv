"assert ((find_max({""name"", ""of"", ""string""}) == ""string""));",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `find_max` function takes a vector of strings as input and returns the word with the maximum number of unique characters. if multiple strings have the same maximum number of unique characters, it returns the one that comes first in lexicographical order.
2. the function iterates through each word in the vector, calculates the number of unique characters in the word, and compares it with the current maximum unique characters found so far.
3. if the number of unique characters in the current word is greater than the current maximum or equal to the current maximum but the word comes before the current maximum word lexicographically, it updates the maximum word and the maximum unique characters.
4. the function then returns the word with the maximum unique characters.

1. the `find_max` function takes a vector of strings as input and returns the word with the maximum number of unique characters. if multiple words have the same maximum number of unique characters, it returns the word that comes first in lexicographical order.
2. the function initializes two variables `max` to store the word with maximum unique characters and `maxu` to store the count of unique characters.
3. it iterates through each word in the input vector and calculates the number of unique characters in each word.
4. if the current word has more unique characters than the previous maximum or if it has the same number of unique characters but comes before in lexicographical order, it updates the `max` and `maxu`.
5. finally, it returns the word with the maximum unique characters.
6. the code seems to be correct based on the provided description.
