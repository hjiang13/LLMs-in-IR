"assert (any_int(2, 3, 1)==true);",fail,"### thinking process
1. the `any_int` function takes three `float` parameters and checks if they are integers by rounding them.
2. it then checks if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two.
3. if the conditions are met, it returns `true`, otherwise `false`.

"assert (any_int(2.5, 2, 3)==false);",pass,"### thinking process
1. the function `any_int` takes three float numbers as input.
2. it checks if all three numbers are integers by rounding them and comparing with the original value.
3. then, it checks if any one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two.
4. if any of the conditions are met, it returns true, otherwise false.
