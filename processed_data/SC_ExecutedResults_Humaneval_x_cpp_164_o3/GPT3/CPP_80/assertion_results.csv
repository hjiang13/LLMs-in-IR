"assert (is_happy(""a"") == false );",pass,"### thinking process
1. the function `is_happy` checks if a given string meets the criteria of being happy.
2. it returns false if the length of the string is less than 3.
3. it then iterates over the string starting from the third character and checks if the current character is the same as the previous two characters. if it finds a match, it returns false.
4. if the loop completes without finding any consecutive matching characters, it returns true.

1. the `is_happy` function checks if a string is happy based on the given criteria.
2. the function returns false if the length of the string is less than 3.
3. it then iterates through the string and checks if any 3 consecutive characters are the same. if they are, it returns false.
4. if the string passes both conditions, it returns true.

1. the `is_happy` function checks if a given string is happy or not based on the defined criteria.
2. the function first checks if the length of the string is less than 3, in which case it returns false.
3. it then iterates over the string starting from the 3rd character and checks if the current character is the same as the previous two characters. if it finds a match, it returns false.
4. if the function completes the loop without finding any consecutive matching characters, it returns true.

1. the `is_happy` function checks if a given string meets the criteria of being happy.
2. the function returns false if the length of the string is less than 3.
3. it then iterates through the string and checks if every 3 consecutive letters are distinct.
4. if any 3 consecutive letters are not distinct, it returns false. otherwise, it returns true.

"assert (is_happy(""xyy"") == false );",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `is_happy` function checks if a given string meets the criteria of being happy.
2. the criteria are that the string must have a length of at least 3 and every 3 consecutive letters must be distinct.
3. the function iterates through the string and checks if the current letter is the same as the previous two letters. if it finds a match, it returns false.
4. if it completes the loop without finding any matches, it returns true.
