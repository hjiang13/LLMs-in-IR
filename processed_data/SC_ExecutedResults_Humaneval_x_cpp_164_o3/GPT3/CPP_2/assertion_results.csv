assert (truncate_number(3.5) == 0.5);,pass,"### thinking process
1. the `truncate_number` function takes a positive floating-point number as input.
2. it calculates the decimal part of the number by subtracting the integer part from the original number.
3. the assertion statement checks if calling `truncate_number(3.5)` returns 0.5.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (abs(truncate_number(1.33) - 0.33) < 1e-4);,pass,"### thinking process
1. the `truncate_number` function takes a positive floating-point number as input and returns the decimal part of that number.
2. the function calculates the decimal part by subtracting the integer part (obtained by casting the number to an integer) from the original number.
3. the `assert` statement checks if the difference between the result of `truncate_number(1.33)` and `0.33` is less than `1e-4`.
