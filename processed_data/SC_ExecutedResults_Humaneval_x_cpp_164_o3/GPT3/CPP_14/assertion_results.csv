1. the `all_prefixes` function takes a string as input and returns a vector of all prefixes of the input string from shortest to longest.
2. the function iterates through the input string and constructs prefixes by adding characters one by one.
3. the prefixes are stored in a vector and returned at the end.

3. the constructed prefixes are added to the output vector.
4. the assertion statement checks if the output of `all_prefixes(""www"")` is equal to `{""w"", ""ww"", ""www""}`.
