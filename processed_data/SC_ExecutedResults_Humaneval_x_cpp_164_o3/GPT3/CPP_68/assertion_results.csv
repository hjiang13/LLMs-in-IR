1. the `pluck` function iterates through the input vector and finds the smallest even value node.
2. if multiple nodes have the same smallest even value, it chooses the one with the smallest index.
3. if there are no even values or the input vector is empty, it returns an empty vector.
4. the assertion statement checks if the output of `pluck({4,2,3})` is equal to `{2, 1}`.

1. the `pluck` function iterates through the input vector to find the smallest even value and its index.
2. it returns a vector containing the smallest even value and its index.
3. if there are multiple nodes with the same smallest even value, it returns the one with the smallest index.
