1. the function `is_nested` takes a string as input and checks if there is a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket is nested.
2. it iterates through the string, keeping track of the count of opening and closing brackets.
3. if at any point the count of closing brackets exceeds the count of opening brackets, it means the brackets are not nested properly.
4. the function returns true if there is a valid nested subsequence, otherwise false.

1. the given function `is_nested` takes a string input containing only square brackets.
2. it iterates through the string and keeps track of the count of opening and closing brackets.
3. if at any point, the count of closing brackets exceeds the count of opening brackets, it means the brackets are not nested properly.
4. the function returns true if there is a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket is nested.
5. the assertion statement checks if the function returns false for the input `""]]]]]]][[[[[]""`, which should be false as there are no properly nested brackets.
