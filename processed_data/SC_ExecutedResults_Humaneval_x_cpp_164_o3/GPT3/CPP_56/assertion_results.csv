"assert (correct_bracketing(""<>""));",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `correct_bracketing` function takes a string of brackets as input and checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.
2. it initializes a `level` variable to keep track of the balance of brackets.
3. it iterates through the input string, incrementing the `level` for each opening bracket '<' and decrementing for each closing bracket '>'.
4. if at any point the `level` becomes negative, it means there is a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, so it returns false.
5. at the end of the loop, if the `level` is not zero, it means there are unmatched brackets, so it returns false. otherwise, it returns true.

1. the `correct_bracketing` function takes a string of brackets as input and checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.
2. it uses a variable `level` to keep track of the balance of brackets. if an opening bracket is encountered, `level` is incremented by 1. if a closing bracket is encountered, `level` is decremented by 1.
3. if at any point `level` becomes negative, it means there is a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns false.

1. the `correct_bracketing` function checks if every opening bracket '<' has a corresponding closing bracket '>'.
2. it maintains a `level` variable to keep track of the balance of opening and closing brackets.
3. if at any point, the `level` becomes negative or at the end it is not zero, then the bracketing is incorrect.

1. the `correct_bracketing` function checks if every opening bracket `<` has a corresponding closing bracket `>`.
