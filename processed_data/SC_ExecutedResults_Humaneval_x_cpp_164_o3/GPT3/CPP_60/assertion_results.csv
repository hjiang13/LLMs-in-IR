assert (sum_to_n(1) == 1);,pass,"### thinking process
1. the given c/c++ code defines a function `sum_to_n` that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n using the formula `n*(n+1)/2`.
2. the assertion statement checks if the result of `sum_to_n(1)` is equal to 1.
3. we will evaluate the function `sum_to_n` for the input value of 1 and compare the result with the expected output of 1.

### assertion results

1. the given c/c++ code defines a function `sum_to_n` that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n using the formula `n*(n+1)/2`.
2. we need to evaluate the assertion `assert (sum_to_n(6) == 21)` to determine if it passes or fails.
3. for `n = 6`, the expected sum is `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21`.
4. the function `sum_to_n(6)` should return `21` if it is implemented correctly.

2. we need to evaluate the assertion statement `assert (sum_to_n(11) == 66)` to determine if it passes or fails.
3. for `n = 11`, the expected sum should be `1 + 2 + ... + 11 = 66`.
4. we will calculate the sum using the `sum_to_n` function and compare it with the expected value of 66.

1. the function `sum_to_n` calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n using the formula `n*(n+1)/2`.
2. we need to verify if the function is correctly summing numbers from 1 to n.
3. we will evaluate the provided assertion statement `assert (sum_to_n(30) == 465)`.

assert (sum_to_n(100) == 5050);,pass,"### thinking process
1. the `sum_to_n` function calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n using the formula `n*(n+1)/2`.
2. we need to verify if the `sum_to_n` function returns the correct sum for the given input values.
3. we will evaluate each assertion statement by calling the `sum_to_n` function with the provided input and comparing the result with the expected sum.

### assertion results
- **assertion result**: **pass** (sum_to_n(30) returns 465, which is correct)
- **assertion result**: **pass** (sum_to_n(100) returns 5050, which is correct)
- **assertion result**: **pass** (sum_to_n(5) returns 15, which is correct)
- **assertion result**: **pass** (sum_to_n(10) returns 55, which is correct)
- **assertion result**: **pass** (sum_to_n(1) returns 1, which is correct)"
