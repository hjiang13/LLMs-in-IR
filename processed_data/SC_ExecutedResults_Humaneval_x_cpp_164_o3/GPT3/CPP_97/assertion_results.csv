1. the `multiply` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns the product of their unit digits.
2. the function calculates the unit digit of `a` and `b` using `abs(a)%10` and `abs(b)%10` respectively.
3. it then returns the product of these unit digits.

1. the `multiply` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input.
2. it calculates the product of the unit digits of `a` and `b` by taking the absolute value of `a` and `b`, then finding the remainder when divided by 10.
3. the result is returned as the product of the unit digits.
4. the assertion statement checks if calling `multiply(19, 28)` returns 72.

"assert (multiply(14,-15) == 20   );",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `multiply` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns the product of their unit digits.
2. the function first takes the absolute value of both `a` and `b` using the `abs` function to handle negative numbers.
3. then it calculates the product of the unit digits of `a` and `b` by taking the remainder when divided by 10.
4. the result is returned as the product of the unit digits of `a` and `b`.
