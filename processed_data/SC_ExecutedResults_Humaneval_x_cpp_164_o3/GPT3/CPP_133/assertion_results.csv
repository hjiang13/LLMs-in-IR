"assert (sum_squares({1,2,3})==14);",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `sum_squares` function takes a vector of floats as input and calculates the sum of squared numbers after rounding each element to the upper integer (ceiling).
2. the function iterates through each element in the vector, rounds it to the upper integer using `ceil` function, squares it, and adds it to the sum.
3. the final sum is returned as the output.

"assert (sum_squares({1.0,2,3})==14);",pass,"### thinking process
1. the function `sum_squares` takes a vector of floats as input and calculates the sum of squared numbers after rounding each element to the nearest integer.
2. the function uses the `ceil` function from the `math.h` library to round each element to the upper integer.
3. it then squares the rounded number and adds it to the sum.
4. the final sum is returned.
