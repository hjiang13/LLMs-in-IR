assert (fizz_buzz(50) == 0);,pass,"### thinking process
1. the `fizz_buzz` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13.
2. the function initializes a count variable to 0 and iterates through integers from 0 to `n-1`.
3. for each integer that is divisible by 11 or 13, it checks each digit of the integer to see if it is equal to 7.
4. if a digit is 7, it increments the count variable.
5. finally, the function returns the count of occurrences of digit 7.

1. the `fizz_buzz` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13.
2. the function initializes a count variable to keep track of the number of times digit 7 appears.
3. it then iterates through numbers from 0 to n-1 and checks if the number is divisible by 11 or 13.
4. for each number that meets the criteria, it extracts each digit of the number and checks if it is equal to 7. if so, it increments the count.
5. finally, it returns the count of occurrences of digit 7.
