1. the given c++ code defines a function `select_words` that takes a string `s` and a natural number `n` as input and returns a vector of words from the string `s` that contain exactly `n` consonants.
2. the function iterates through the string, counts the number of consonants in each word, and adds the word to the output vector if it contains exactly `n` consonants.
3. the function considers vowels to be 'aeiouaeiou' and counts the number of consonants accordingly.
4. the function returns an empty vector if the input string is empty.

1. the `select_words` function takes a string `s` and a natural number `n` as input.
2. it iterates through the string `s` to find words with exactly `n` consonants.
