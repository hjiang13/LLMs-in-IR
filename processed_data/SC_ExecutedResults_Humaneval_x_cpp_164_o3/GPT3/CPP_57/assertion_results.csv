"assert (monotonic({1, 2, 4, 10}) == true);",fail,"### thinking process
1. the `monotonic` function takes a vector of floats as input and checks if the elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing.
2. it uses two flags `incr` and `decr` to track if there is an increase or decrease in the elements.
3. if both flags are set (i.e., both increase and decrease are detected), then the function returns false, indicating that the elements are not monotonic.
4. otherwise, it returns true.

### assertion result
- **assertion result**: **fail**"
"assert (monotonic({1, 2, 4, 20}) == true);",unknown,"### thinking process
1. the `monotonic` function takes a vector of floats as input and checks if the elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing.
2. it initializes two flags `incr` and `decr` to 0.
3. it then iterates through the vector and updates the flags based on the comparison of current and previous elements.
4. if both flags are set (i.e., both increasing and decreasing conditions are met), it returns false indicating the vector is not monotonic.
5. otherwise, it returns true.
