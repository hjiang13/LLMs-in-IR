"assert (string_sequence(0) == ""0"");",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `string_sequence` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to `n` inclusive.
2. the function initializes the output string `out` with ""0"" and then iterates from 1 to `n`, appending each number to the output string with a space in between.
3. the function returns the final output string.

2. the function initializes the output string `out` with ""0"" and then iterates from 1 to `n`, appending each number to the output string with a space in between.
3. the function uses the `to_string` function to convert integers to strings before appending them to the output string.
