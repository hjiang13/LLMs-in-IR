"assert (issame(remove_duplicates({}) , {}));",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `remove_duplicates` function takes a vector of integers as input and removes all elements that occur more than once.
2. it maintains two additional vectors `has1` and `has2` to keep track of elements that have occurred once and more than once, respectively.
3. it then iterates through the input vector, checks if the element is in `has1` or `has2`, and updates accordingly.
4. finally, it constructs and returns a new vector with unique elements.

### assertion result

1. the `remove_duplicates` function takes a vector of integers as input and removes all elements that occur more than once while maintaining the order of elements.
2. the function uses two additional vectors `has1` and `has2` to keep track of elements that have occurred once and more than once, respectively.
3. it iterates through the input vector and populates `has1` and `has2` accordingly.
4. finally, it constructs the output vector `out` by including only those elements that are not present in `has2`.
5. the assertion statement checks if the output of `remove_duplicates({1, 2, 3, 4})` is equal to `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.
