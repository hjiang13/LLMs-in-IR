"assert (move_one_ball({3, 4, 5, 1, 2})==true);",unknown,"### thinking process
1. the function `move_one_ball` takes a vector of integers as input and checks if it is possible to obtain a sorted vector in non-decreasing order by performing right shift operations.
2. it checks if the vector is empty and returns true in that case.
3. it iterates through the vector and counts the number of elements that are not in non-decreasing order.
4. if the count is less than 2, it means it is possible to obtain a sorted vector by performing right shift operations.
5. otherwise, it returns false.

### assertion result
- **assertion**: `move_one_ball({3, 4, 5, 1, 2})==true`
  - **result**: pass"

1. the function `move_one_ball` checks if it is possible to obtain a sorted vector by performing right shift operations.
2. it iterates through the vector and counts the number of times a number is less than the previous number.
3. if the count is less than 2, it means the vector can be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. if the last element is greater than the first element, it also increments the count.
5. if the count is less than 2, the function returns true, indicating it is possible to sort the vector.

1. the function `move_one_ball` takes a vector of integers as input and checks if it is possible to sort the vector in non-decreasing order by performing right shift operations.
2. it initializes a variable `num` to count the number of elements that are not in non-decreasing order.
3. if the input vector is empty, it returns true.
4. it then iterates through the vector and increments `num` whenever an element is less than the previous element.
5. it also checks if the last element is greater than the first element and increments `num` accordingly.
6. if `num` is less than 2, it means it is possible to sort the vector in non-decreasing order, so it returns true. otherwise, it returns false.

1. the function `move_one_ball` takes a vector of integers as input and checks if it is possible to obtain a sorted vector in non-decreasing order by performing right shift operations.
2. the function first checks if the input vector is empty, in which case it returns true.
3. it then iterates through the vector and counts the number of times the elements are not in non-decreasing order.
4. if the count is less than 2, it means it is possible to obtain a sorted vector by performing right shift operations.

assert (move_one_ball({})==true);,pass,"### thinking process
1. the function `move_one_ball` takes a vector of integers as input and checks if it is possible to obtain a sorted vector in non-decreasing order by performing right shift operations.
2. if the input vector is empty, the function should return true.
3. the function iterates through the vector and counts the number of times where an element is less than the previous element.
4. if the count is less than 2, it means the vector can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing right shift operations.
5. if the last element is greater than the first element, it also contributes to the count.
6. if the total count is less than 2, the function returns true, indicating that the vector can be sorted.
7. otherwise, it returns false.
