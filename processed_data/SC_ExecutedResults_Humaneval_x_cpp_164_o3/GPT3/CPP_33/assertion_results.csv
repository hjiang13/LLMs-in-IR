1. the `sort_third` function takes a vector `l` and returns a modified vector based on the rules mentioned in the comments.
2. the function extracts values from `l` at indices divisible by three, sorts them, and then replaces the values at those indices in the output vector.
3. the function then returns the modified vector.
4. the assertion statement compares the output of `sort_third({1, 2, 3})` with itself, which should always be true if the function is implemented correctly.

1. the `sort_third` function takes a vector `l` and follows the rules mentioned in the comments.
2. it extracts the values at indices divisible by three, sorts them, and then inserts them back into the original vector at the same indices.
3. the function seems to be correctly implemented based on the provided description.

1. the `sort_third` function takes a vector `l` as input and follows the specified logic to create a new vector `out`.
2. the logic involves creating a vector `third` with values at indices divisible by three sorted.
3. then, the function iterates over the input vector `l` and populates the output vector `out` based on the specified conditions.
4. the assertion statement checks if the output of `sort_third({5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2})` matches the expected vector `{2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5}`.

1. the `sort_third` function first extracts every third element from the input vector `l` and sorts them in a separate vector called `third`.
2. then, it creates an output vector `out` where it replaces every third element with the sorted values from `third`.
3. the function returns the modified vector `out`.

1. the `sort_third` function first extracts every third element from the input vector `l` and sorts them in ascending order.
