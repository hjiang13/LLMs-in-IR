assert (is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == false);,pass,"### thinking process
1. the function `is_equal_to_sum_even` checks if the given number `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.
2. it returns `true` if `n` is even and greater than or equal to 8, otherwise it returns `false`.

- the function `is_equal_to_sum_even` checks if a given number `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.
- it returns `true` if `n` is even and greater than or equal to 8, indicating that it can be expressed as the sum of 4 positive even numbers.
- otherwise, it returns `false`.

assert (is_equal_to_sum_even(10) == true);,pass,"### thinking process
- the function `is_equal_to_sum_even` checks if the given number `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.
- it returns true if `n` is even and greater than or equal to 8, as 8 is the smallest even number that can be expressed as the sum of 4 positive even numbers.
- for example, 8 = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2.
- if `n` is not even or less than 8, the function returns false.

1. the function `is_equal_to_sum_even` checks if the given number `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.
2. it returns `true` if `n` is even and greater than or equal to 8, otherwise it returns `false`.
3. the assertion statement is checking if `is_equal_to_sum_even(11)` returns `false`.

assert (is_equal_to_sum_even(12) == true);,pass,"### thinking process
- the function `is_equal_to_sum_even` checks if the given number `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.
- it returns true if `n` is even and greater than or equal to 8, as it would require at least 4 even numbers to sum up to `n`.
