assert (is_sorted({5}) == true);,pass,"### thinking process
1. the `is_sorted` function takes a vector of integers as input and checks if the vector is sorted in ascending order.
2. it also checks if there are more than 1 duplicate of the same number in the vector.
3. the function iterates through the vector and checks if each element is greater than or equal to the previous element. if not, it returns false.
4. it also checks if the current element is equal to the previous two elements, in which case it returns false.
5. if the function completes the loop without returning false, it returns true.
