"assert (add({4, 88}) == 88);",fail,"### thinking process
1. the function `add` takes a vector of integers as input and adds the even elements that are at odd indices.
2. the loop in the function iterates over the vector elements at odd indices (i*2+1) and checks if the element is even. if it is even, it adds it to the sum.
3. the function returns the sum of even elements at odd indices.

1. the function `add` takes a vector of integers as input and adds the even elements that are at odd indices.
2. the loop in the function iterates over the indices of the vector and checks if the element at that index is even and at an odd index.
3. if the condition is met, the element is added to the sum.
4. the assertion statement checks if the function returns the correct sum for the provided vector.

1. the function `add` takes a vector of integers as input and adds the even elements that are at odd indices.
2. it iterates through the vector and checks if the element at the odd index is even, then adds it to the sum.
3. the index calculation `i*2+1` is used to access elements at odd indices.
4. the provided assertion statement checks if the function returns 0 when the input vector is {4, 0, 6, 7}.

2. the function iterates through the vector and checks if the element at the odd index is even, then adds it to the sum.
3. the loop condition `i*2+1<lst.size()` ensures that we are accessing elements at odd indices.
4. the assertion statement is checking if the function correctly adds the even elements at odd indices from the given vector.
