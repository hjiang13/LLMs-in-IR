"assert (issame(order_by_points({1, 11, -1, -11, -12}) , {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}));",fail,"### thinking process
1. the given function `order_by_points` takes a vector of integers and sorts them based on the sum of their digits.
2. the function calculates the sum of digits for each number and stores it in a separate vector `sumdigit`.
3. it then sorts the original vector `nums` based on the values in `sumdigit`.
4. the sorting is done in ascending order.
5. the function returns the sorted vector `nums`.
