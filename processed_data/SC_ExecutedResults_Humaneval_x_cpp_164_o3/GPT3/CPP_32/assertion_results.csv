"assert (abs(poly(coeffs, solution))< 1e-3);",fail,"### thinking process
1. the `poly` function evaluates a polynomial with coefficients `xs` at a point `x` by summing up the products of coefficients and powers of `x`.
2. the `find_zero` function finds a zero point of the polynomial by iteratively updating the value of `ans` until the absolute value of the polynomial evaluated at `ans` is less than `1e-6`.
3. the assertion statement checks if the absolute value of the polynomial evaluated at `solution` using coefficients `coeffs` is less than `1e-3`.

### assertion result
- **assertion result**: **fail**"
