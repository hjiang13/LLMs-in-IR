assert (issame(get_row({,unknown,"### thinking process
1. the given c++ function `get_row` takes a 2d vector `lst` and an integer `x` as input.
2. it iterates through each element in the 2d vector to find the integer `x`.
3. if `x` is found in the vector, it adds the coordinates (row, column) to the output vector.
4. the output vector is sorted by rows in ascending order and by columns in descending order.
5. the function returns the output vector.

assert (issame(get_row({,fail,"### thinking process
1. the given c++ code defines a function `get_row` that takes a 2d vector `lst` and an integer `x` as input.
2. the function iterates through the rows and columns of the 2d vector to find the integer `x`.
3. if `x` is found in a cell, the function adds the coordinates of that cell to the output vector `out`.
4. the coordinates are represented as pairs {row, column}.
5. the function then returns the vector of coordinates.
6. the assertion statement is incomplete and needs to be completed to test the function.

### assertion statement
```
assert (issame(get_row({
  {1,2,3,4,5,6},
  {1,2,3,4,1,6},
  {1,2,3,4,5,1}
}, 1), {{0, 0}, {1, 4}, {1, 0}, {2, 5}, {2, 0}});
```
