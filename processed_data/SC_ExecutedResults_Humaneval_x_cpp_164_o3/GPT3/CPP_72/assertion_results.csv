"assert (will_it_fly({3, 2, 3}, 9)==true);",pass,"### thinking process
1. the function `will_it_fly` takes a vector of integers `q` and an integer `w` as input.
2. it checks if the vector `q` is balanced (palindromic) and if the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum weight `w`.
3. it iterates through the vector to check if it is palindromic and calculates the sum of its elements.
4. if the vector is not palindromic or the sum exceeds the maximum weight, it returns false. otherwise, it returns true.

### assertion result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"

1. the function `will_it_fly` takes a vector of integers `q` and an integer `w` as input.
2. it checks if the vector `q` is balanced (palindromic) by comparing elements from both ends towards the middle.
3. it calculates the sum of all elements in the vector `q`.
4. if the vector is not balanced or if the sum of elements is greater than `w`, it returns false. otherwise, it returns true.
