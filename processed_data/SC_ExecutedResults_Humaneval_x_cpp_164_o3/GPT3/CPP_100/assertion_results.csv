1. the `make_a_pile` function takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns a vector containing the number of stones in each level.
2. the function initializes the vector with the first level having `n` stones.
3. it then iterates from 1 to `n-1` and adds the next odd or even number based on the current level's number of stones.
4. the function returns the vector containing the number of stones in each level.
5. the assertion statement checks if the output of `make_a_pile(3)` matches the expected vector `{3, 5, 7}`.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"

1. the `make_a_pile` function takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns a vector containing the number of stones in each level.
2. the function starts with `n` stones in the first level and then adds 2 stones for each subsequent level.
3. if `n` is odd, the next level will have an odd number of stones, and if `n` is even, the next level will have an even number of stones.
4. the assertion statement checks if the output of `make_a_pile(4)` matches the vector `{4, 6, 8, 10}`.

1. the `make_a_pile` function takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns a vector containing the number of stones in each level based on the given rules.
2. the function starts with `n` stones in the first level and then adds 2 stones for each subsequent level.
3. we need to test the function with an example input `5` and check if the output matches the expected vector `{5, 7, 9, 11, 13}`.

1. the `make_a_pile` function takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns a vector of integers representing the number of stones in each level.
2. the function initializes the vector `out` with the first level having `n` stones.
3. it then iterates from 1 to `n-1` and adds the next odd or even number based on the current level's stones to the vector.
4. finally, it returns the vector `out`.
