"assert (next_smallest({1, 2, 3, 4, 5}) == 2);",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `next_smallest` function takes a vector of integers as input and sorts the vector in ascending order.
2. it then iterates through the sorted vector and returns the first element that is different from its previous element, which would be the 2nd smallest element.
3. if there is no such element, it returns -1.

1. the `next_smallest` function takes a vector of integers as input and sorts the vector in ascending order.

"assert (next_smallest({1, 1}) == -1);",pass,"### thinking process
1. the function `next_smallest()` takes a vector of integers as input and returns the 2nd smallest element in the vector.
2. the function first sorts the input vector in ascending order.
3. it then iterates through the sorted vector and returns the first element that is different from its previous element.
4. if there is no such element (i.e., all elements are the same), the function returns -1.

1. the function `next_smallest()` takes a vector of integers as input and returns the 2nd smallest element in the vector.
2. the function first sorts the input vector in ascending order.
3. it then iterates through the sorted vector and returns the first element that is different from its previous element (2nd smallest).
4. if there is no 2nd smallest element (e.g., all elements are the same), it returns -1.

1. the function `next_smallest()` takes a vector of integers as input and sorts the vector in ascending order.
2. it then iterates through the sorted vector to find the 2nd smallest element by comparing each element with its previous element.
3. if there is no 2nd smallest element, the function returns -1.
