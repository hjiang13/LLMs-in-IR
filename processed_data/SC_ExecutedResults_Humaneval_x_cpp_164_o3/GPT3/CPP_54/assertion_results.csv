1. the `same_chars` function takes two strings as input and checks if they have the same characters.
2. the function iterates through each character in the first string and checks if it exists in the second string. if not found, it returns false.
3. it then iterates through each character in the second string and checks if it exists in the first string. if not found, it returns false.
4. if all characters are found in both strings, it returns true.

2. it iterates over each character in the first string and checks if that character exists in the second string using the `find` function.
