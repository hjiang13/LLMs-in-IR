"assert (issame(rolling_max({}),{}));",fail,"### thinking process
1. the `rolling_max` function takes a vector of integers as input and generates a new vector with rolling maximum elements.
2. the function iterates through the input vector, updating the maximum element found so far and adding it to the output vector.
3. the function returns the output vector with rolling maximum elements.
4. the assertion statement is comparing the output of `rolling_max({})` with an empty vector `{}`.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **fail**"
"assert (issame(rolling_max({1, 2, 3, 4}) , {1, 2, 3, 4}));",fail,"### thinking process
1. the `rolling_max` function takes a vector of integers as input and generates a new vector with rolling maximum elements.
2. it initializes a variable `max` to 0 and iterates through the input vector.
3. at each iteration, it compares the current element with the current maximum value (`max`) and updates `max` if the current element is greater.
4. it then appends the current maximum value to the output vector.
5. finally, it returns the output vector.

"assert (issame(rolling_max({4, 3, 2, 1}),{4, 4, 4, 4}));",fail,"### thinking process
1. the `rolling_max` function takes a vector of integers as input and generates a new vector containing the rolling maximum element found until a given moment in the sequence.
2. the function iterates through the input vector and updates the maximum value encountered so far.
3. the rolling maximum is stored in the `out` vector and returned at the end.

"assert (issame(rolling_max({3, 2, 3, 100, 3}) ,{3, 3, 3, 100, 100}));",fail,"### thinking process
1. the `rolling_max` function takes a vector of integers as input and generates a new vector where each element is the rolling maximum element found until that moment in the sequence.
2. the function iterates through the input vector, updating the maximum value encountered so far and appending it to the output vector.
3. the provided assertion statement compares the output of the `rolling_max` function with the expected vector `{3, 3, 3, 100, 100}` for the input vector `{3, 2, 3, 100, 3}`.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **fail**"
