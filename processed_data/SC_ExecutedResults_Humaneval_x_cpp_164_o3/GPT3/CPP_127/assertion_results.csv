"assert (intersection({1, 2}, {2, 3}) == ""NO"");",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `intersection` function takes two intervals as input and calculates the intersection length.
2. it then checks if the length of the intersection is a prime number.
3. if the length is less than 2, it returns ""no"" as the intervals don't intersect.
4. if the length is a prime number, it returns ""yes"".
5. otherwise, it returns ""no"".

1. the `intersection` function takes two intervals as input and calculates the intersection length.
2. it then checks if the intersection length is a prime number or not.
3. if the intersection length is less than 2, it returns ""no"" as prime numbers start from 2.
4. it then checks if the intersection length is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of the length. if it is divisible, it returns ""no"".
5. if the intersection length passes both conditions, it returns ""yes"".

1. the `intersection` function takes two intervals as input, represented by vectors of integers.
2. it calculates the intersection of the two intervals by finding the maximum of the starting points and the minimum of the ending points.
3. it then calculates the length of the intersection and checks if it is a prime number.
4. if the length is less than 2, it returns ""no"" as the intervals do not intersect.
5. if the length is a prime number, it returns ""yes"", otherwise ""no"".

2. it then checks if the length of the intersection is a prime number or not.
3. if the length is less than 2, it returns ""no"" as prime numbers are greater than 1.

2. it calculates the intersection of the two intervals and checks if the length of the intersection is a prime number.
3. if the length is less than 2, it returns ""no"" immediately.
4. otherwise, it checks if the length is a prime number by iterating from 2 to the square root of the length.
5. if the length is divisible by any number in that range, it returns ""no"". otherwise, it returns ""yes"".

1. the `intersection` function takes two intervals as input and calculates the intersection length between them.
2. it then checks if the length of the intersection is a prime number or not.
3. if the length is less than 2, it returns ""no"" as it cannot be a prime number.
4. if the length is greater than or equal to 2, it checks if the length is a prime number by iterating from 2 to the square root of the length.
5. if the length is divisible by any number in that range, it returns ""no"" as it is not a prime number.
6. if the length is not divisible by any number in that range, it returns ""yes"" as it is a prime number.
