1. the `do_algebra` function takes two vectors as input, one for operators and one for operands.
2. it iterates through the operators and operands to perform the algebraic operations in the correct order.
3. the function uses a post-order traversal approach to evaluate the expression.
4. the function correctly handles exponentiation, multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction.
5. the final result is returned after all operations are performed.

1. the `do_algebra` function takes two vectors as input - one for operators and one for operands.
2. the function iterates through the operators in the order of precedence and performs the corresponding operation on the operands.
3. the function uses a post-order traversal approach to evaluate the expression.
4. the result is stored in the first element of the `operand` vector and returned.

"assert (do_algebra({""//"", ""*""}, {7, 3, 4}) == 8);",fail,"### thinking process
1. the `do_algebra` function takes two vectors as input - one for operators and one for operands.
2. it performs the algebraic operations based on the operators provided and returns the final result.
3. the function first handles exponentiation, then multiplication/division, and finally addition/subtraction.
4. the function uses a vector `posto` to keep track of the positions of operands.
5. the function modifies the operands vector based on the operations and positions.
