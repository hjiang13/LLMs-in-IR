"assert (issame(filter_by_prefix({}, ""john"") , {}));",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `filter_by_prefix` function takes in a vector of strings and a prefix string.
2. it filters the input vector of strings for ones that start with the given prefix.
3. the function returns a new vector containing only the strings that match the prefix.
4. the assertion statement is comparing the output of `filter_by_prefix({}, ""john"")` with an empty vector `{}`.

### assertion result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"

1. the `filter_by_prefix` function takes a vector of strings and a prefix as input.
2. it filters the input vector to only include strings that start with the given prefix.
3. the function returns a new vector containing the filtered strings.
4. the assertion statement is comparing the output of the `filter_by_prefix` function with an expected vector of strings.
5. we need to check if the function correctly filters the input vector based on the prefix.

### assertion result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
