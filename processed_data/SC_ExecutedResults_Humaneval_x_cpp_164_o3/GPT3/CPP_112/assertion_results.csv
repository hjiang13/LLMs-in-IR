"assert (issame(reverse_delete(""abcde"",""ae"") , {""bcd"",""False""}));",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `reverse_delete` function takes two strings `s` and `c` as input and removes all characters in `s` that are equal to any character in `c`.
2. it then checks if the resulting string is a palindrome or not.
3. if the resulting string is empty, it returns ""true"" as it is considered a palindrome.
4. if the resulting string is not empty, it checks if the reversed string is equal to the original string to determine if it is a palindrome.
5. the function returns a vector containing the resulting string and either ""true"" or ""false"" based on the palindrome check.

1. the `reverse_delete` function takes two strings `s` and `c`, deletes all characters in `s` that are equal to any character in `c`, and then checks if the resulting string is a palindrome.
2. it returns a vector containing the result string and either ""true"" or ""false"" based on whether the result string is a palindrome.
3. the function uses a loop to iterate over the characters in `s`, checks if each character is not in `c`, and constructs a new string `n` without those characters.
4. it then checks if `n` is empty, if it is, it returns `{n, ""true""}`.
5. if `n` is not empty, it reverses `n` and compares it with the original `n` to determine if it is a palindrome.
6. the function returns `{n, ""true""}` if it is a palindrome, otherwise it returns `{n, ""false""}`.
