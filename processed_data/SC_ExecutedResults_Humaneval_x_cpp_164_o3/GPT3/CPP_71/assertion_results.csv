1. the `triangle_area` function calculates the area of a triangle given the lengths of its three sides.
2. the function first checks if the three sides form a valid triangle by ensuring that the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. if not, it returns -1.
3. if the sides form a valid triangle, the function calculates the area using heron's formula.
4. the assertion statement checks if the calculated area for sides (3, 4, 5) is approximately equal to 6.00 with a tolerance of 0.01.
