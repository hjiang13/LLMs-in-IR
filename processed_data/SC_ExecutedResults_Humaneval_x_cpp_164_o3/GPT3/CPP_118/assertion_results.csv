"assert (get_closest_vowel(""yogurt"") == ""u"");",pass,"### thinking process
1. the function `get_closest_vowel` takes a string as input and iterates through the string from right to left.
2. it checks if the character at the current position is a vowel and if the characters on its left and right are consonants.
3. if these conditions are met, it returns the closest vowel that satisfies the conditions.
4. if no such vowel is found, it returns an empty string.
