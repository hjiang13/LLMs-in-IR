1. the `eat` function takes in three parameters: `number` (the number of carrots already eaten), `need` (the number of carrots needed to eat), and `remaining` (the number of remaining carrots in stock).
2. if the number of needed carrots is greater than the remaining carrots, the function should return a vector with the total number of eaten carrots as `number + remaining` and the number of remaining carrots as 0.
3. if there are enough remaining carrots, the function should return a vector with the total number of eaten carrots as `number + need` and the number of remaining carrots as `remaining - need`.

1. the `eat` function takes in three parameters: `number`, `need`, and `remaining`.
2. it calculates the total number of eaten carrots after the meals and the number of carrots left after the meals.
3. if the `need` is greater than the `remaining`, it returns the total number of eaten carrots as `number + remaining` and the number of carrots left as `0`.
4. otherwise, it returns the total number of eaten carrots as `number + need` and the number of carrots left as `remaining - need`.

1. given function `eat` takes in three integers: `number`, `need`, and `remaining`.
2. if the `need` is greater than `remaining`, return a vector with the total number of eaten carrots as `number + remaining` and the number of remaining carrots as 0.
3. otherwise, return a vector with the total number of eaten carrots as `number + need` and the number of remaining carrots as `remaining - need`.
4. the assertion statement is checking if `eat(4, 5, 7)` returns `{9, 2}`.
