"assert (issame(factorize(2) , {2}));",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `factorize` function takes an integer `n` and returns a vector of prime factors of `n`.
2. the function iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` and checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. if it is, it divides `n` by `i` and adds `i` to the output vector.
3. the function continues this process until `n` is no longer divisible by any number in the range.
4. finally, it adds the remaining `n` to the output vector.

1. the `factorize` function takes an integer input and returns a vector of prime factors of that integer.
2. the function iterates from 2 to the square root of the input number and checks if the number is divisible by `i`. if it is, it divides the number by `i` and adds `i` to the output vector.
3. the function continues this process until the number is no longer divisible by `i`, then adds the remaining number to the output vector.
4. the output vector contains the prime factors of the input number in ascending order.

1. the `factorize` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a vector of prime factors of `n`.
2. the function iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` and checks if `n` is divisible by `i`.
3. if `n` is divisible by `i`, it divides `n` by `i`, adds `i` to the output vector, and decrements `i` by 1 to check for repeated factors.
4. finally, it adds the remaining `n` to the output vector.
5. the assertion statement checks if the output of `factorize(8)` is equal to `{2, 2, 2}`.
