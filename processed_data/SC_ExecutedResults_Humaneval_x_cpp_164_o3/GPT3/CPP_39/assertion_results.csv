assert (prime_fib(1) == 2);,pass,"### thinking process
1. the `prime_fib` function calculates the n-th number that is both a fibonacci number and a prime number.
2. the function iterates through fibonacci numbers and checks if they are prime until it finds the n-th number that satisfies both conditions.
3. the function returns the n-th prime fibonacci number.

1. the `prime_fib` function calculates the n-th number that is both a fibonacci number and a prime number.
2. it uses a while loop to generate fibonacci numbers and checks if they are prime.
3. the function returns the n-th prime fibonacci number.
4. the assertion statement checks if `prime_fib(2)` returns 3.

assert (prime_fib(4) == 13);,pass,"### thinking process
1. the `prime_fib` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the n-th number that is both a fibonacci number and a prime number.
2. the function starts by initializing two fibonacci numbers `f1=1` and `f2=2`.
3. it then iterates through fibonacci numbers until it finds the n-th number that is both prime and a fibonacci number.
4. it checks if a number is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility.
5. once it finds the n-th prime fibonacci number, it returns that number.

1. the `prime_fib` function is designed to return the n-th number that is both a fibonacci number and a prime number.
2. the function iterates through fibonacci numbers and checks if each number is prime.
3. it stops when it finds the n-th number that satisfies both conditions.
4. the function seems to be correctly implemented to find the desired number.

1. the `prime_fib` function calculates the n-th number that is both a fibonacci number and a prime number.
2. the function starts with the first two fibonacci numbers (1 and 2) and iterates to find the next fibonacci number that is also prime.
3. it checks if a number is prime by iterating up to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility.
4. the function returns the n-th prime fibonacci number.

assert (prime_fib(10) == 433494437);,fail,"### thinking process
1. the given c/c++ code defines a function `prime_fib` that returns the n-th number that is both a fibonacci number and a prime number.
2. the function calculates the fibonacci numbers and checks if they are prime until it finds the n-th number that satisfies both conditions.
3. the function returns the n-th prime fibonacci number.

### assertion result
- **assertion result**: **fail** 

### explanation
- the assertion statement `assert (prime_fib(10) == 433494437);` is checking if the 10th prime fibonacci number is equal to 433494437.
- however, the 10th prime fibonacci number is actually 199.
- therefore, the assertion fails."
