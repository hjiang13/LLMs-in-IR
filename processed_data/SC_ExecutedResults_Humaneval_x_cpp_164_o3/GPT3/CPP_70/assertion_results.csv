1. the given function `strange_sort_list` takes a vector of integers and returns a vector sorted in a strange order as described in the comments.
2. the function sorts the input vector in ascending order and then constructs the output vector by alternating between the minimum and maximum values from the sorted input vector.
3. if the input vector has an odd number of elements, the middle element (minimum and maximum are the same) will be added at the end.
4. the assertion statement checks if the output of `strange_sort_list({1, 2, 3, 4})` matches the expected output `{1, 4, 2, 3}`.

### final result

1. the `strange_sort_list` function takes a vector of integers and sorts it in a strange order as described in the comments.
2. the function sorts the input vector in ascending order and then constructs the output vector by taking the minimum and maximum values alternately from the sorted vector.

1. the `strange_sort_list` function takes a vector of integers and sorts it in a strange order as described in the comments.
2. the function sorts the input vector in ascending order first.
3. then it iterates from both ends of the sorted vector, pushing the minimum and maximum values alternatively into the output vector.
4. if the size of the input vector is odd, the middle element will be pushed at the end.
5. the function returns the output vector.
