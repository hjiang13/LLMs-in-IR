1. the `unique` function takes a vector of integers as input and returns a vector containing sorted unique elements.
2. the function iterates through the input vector and checks if the element is already present in the output vector.
3. if the element is not present in the output vector, it is added to the output vector.
4. finally, the output vector is sorted before returning.

### assertion result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
