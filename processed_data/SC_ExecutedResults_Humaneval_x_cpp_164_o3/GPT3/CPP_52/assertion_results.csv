"assert (below_threshold({1, 2, 4, 10}, 100));",pass,"### thinking process
1. the function `below_threshold` takes a vector of integers `l` and an integer `t` as input.
2. it iterates through each element in the vector `l` and checks if the element is greater than or equal to the threshold `t`.
3. if any element in the vector is greater than or equal to `t`, the function returns false. otherwise, it returns true.

### assertion result

1. the given function `below_threshold` takes a vector of integers `l` and an integer `t` as input.
2. it iterates through each element in the vector `l` and checks if the element is greater than or equal to the threshold `t`.
3. if any element is greater than or equal to `t`, it returns `false`, indicating that not all numbers are below the threshold.
4. if all elements are below the threshold, it returns `true`.
