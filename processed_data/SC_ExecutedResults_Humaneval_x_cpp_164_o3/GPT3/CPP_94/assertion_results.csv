1. the function `skjkasdkd` takes a vector of integers as input and finds the largest prime value from the vector.
2. it then calculates the sum of the digits of the largest prime value and returns it.
3. the code checks for prime numbers by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number.
4. the code converts the largest prime number to a string and calculates the sum of its digits.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
