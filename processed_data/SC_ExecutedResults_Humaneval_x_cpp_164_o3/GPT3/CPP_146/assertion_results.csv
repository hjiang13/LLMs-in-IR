"assert (specialFilter({5, -2, 1, -5}) == 0  );",fail,"### thinking process
1. the `specialfilter` function takes a vector of integers as input.
2. it iterates through the vector and checks if the number is greater than 10.
3. if the number is greater than 10, it converts the number to a string and checks if the first and last digits are odd.
4. if both conditions are met, it increments the `num` variable.
5. finally, it returns the count of numbers that satisfy the conditions.

1. the `specialfilter` function takes a vector of integers as input and counts the number of elements that are greater than 10 and have both the first and last digits as odd numbers.
2. the function iterates through each element in the vector, checks if the number is greater than 10, converts the number to a string to extract the first and last digits.
3. it then checks if both the first and last digits are odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) and increments the count if the condition is met.
4. finally, it returns the total count of such numbers.
