1. the `hex_key` function takes a string `num` as input and counts the number of hexadecimal digits that are primes.
2. it initializes a string `key` with the prime hexadecimal digits: ""2357bd"".
3. it then iterates through each character in the input string `num` and checks if it is present in the `key` string.
4. if a character is found in the `key` string, it increments the `out` counter.
5. finally, it returns the count of prime hexadecimal digits found in the input string.

1. the function `hex_key` takes a string `num` as input and counts the number of hexadecimal digits that are primes.
2. the prime hexadecimal digits are 2, 3, 5, 7, b (11 in decimal), and d (13 in decimal).
3. the function iterates through the input string and checks if each character is in the key string ""2357bd"".
4. if a character is found in the key string, the count `out` is incremented.
5. the function returns the final count of prime hexadecimal digits found in the input string.

1. the `hex_key` function takes a hexadecimal number as a string and counts the number of hexadecimal digits that are primes.
2. the function defines a string `key` containing the prime hexadecimal digits: ""2357bd"".
3. it then iterates through each character in the input string and checks if it is present in the `key` string.
4. if a character is found in the `key` string, the count is incremented.
5. the function returns the total count of prime hexadecimal digits found in the input string.
