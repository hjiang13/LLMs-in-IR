"assert (issame(histogram(""a b b a"") , {{'a',2},{'b', 2}}));",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `histogram` function takes a string as input and returns a map with the count of each character in the string.
2. the function ignores spaces in the input string.
3. it then finds the character(s) with the maximum count and returns a map with those characters and their counts.
4. the assertion statement is comparing the output of the `histogram` function with an expected map.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"

1. the `histogram` function takes a string as input and returns a map of characters with their corresponding counts.
2. the function iterates through the input string, counts the occurrences of each character (excluding spaces), and keeps track of the maximum count.
3. after counting, it creates a new map `out` containing characters with counts equal to the maximum count.
4. the assertion statement is comparing the output of the `histogram` function with an expected map of characters and counts.
