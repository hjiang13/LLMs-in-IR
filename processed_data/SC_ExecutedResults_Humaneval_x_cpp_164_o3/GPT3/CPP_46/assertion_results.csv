assert (fib4(5) == 4);,pass,"### thinking process
1. the given c/c++ code defines a function `fib4` that computes the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence efficiently without using recursion.
2. the function initializes an array `f` to store the values of the fib4 sequence.
3. it then iterates from 4 to n and calculates the value of each element based on the previous 4 elements in the sequence.
4. finally, it returns the n-th element of the fib4 sequence.

1. the given c/c++ code defines a function `fib4` that calculates the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence efficiently without using recursion.
2. the function initializes an array `f` to store the values of the sequence up to index 3.
3. it then iterates from index 4 to n, calculating each element based on the formula provided.
4. finally, it returns the n-th element of the sequence.
