"assert (anti_shuffle(""Hi"") == ""Hi"");",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `anti_shuffle` function takes a string as input and returns an ordered version of it where all words are replaced by a new word with characters arranged in ascending order based on ascii value.
2. the function iterates through the input string, separates words by spaces, sorts the characters in each word, and then concatenates the sorted words back together.
3. the function returns the final ordered string.

1. the `anti_shuffle` function takes a string as input and returns an ordered version of it where each word is sorted in ascending order based on ascii values.
2. the function iterates through the input string, separates words based on spaces, sorts each word, and then concatenates them back together.
3. the assertion statement checks if calling `anti_shuffle(""hello"")` returns ""ehllo"".

1. the `anti_shuffle` function takes a string as input and returns a new string where each word in the input string is sorted in ascending order based on ascii values.
2. the function loops through the input string, separates words based on spaces, sorts each word, and then concatenates the sorted words back together.
3. the assertion statement is comparing the output of `anti_shuffle(""number"")` with the expected output `""bemnru""`.
4. the expected output is the word ""number"" sorted in ascending order, which should be ""bemnru"".

"assert (anti_shuffle(""abcd"") == ""abcd"");",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `anti_shuffle` function takes a string as input and returns a new string where the characters in each word are arranged in ascending order based on ascii value.
2. the function iterates through the input string, separating words based on spaces, sorts the characters in each word, and then concatenates the sorted words back together.
3. the example provided in the code comments helps understand the expected behavior of the function.

"assert (anti_shuffle(""Hello World!!!"") == ""Hello !!!Wdlor"");",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `anti_shuffle` function takes a string as input and returns an ordered version of it where the characters in each word are arranged in ascending order based on ascii value.
2. the function iterates through the input string, separates words based on spaces, sorts the characters in each word, and then concatenates the sorted words back together.
3. the example provided in the assertion statement is ""hello world!!!"" which should be transformed to ""hello !!!wdlor"" after sorting the characters in each word.

"assert (anti_shuffle("""") == """");",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `anti_shuffle` function takes a string as input and returns an ordered version of it where the characters in each word are arranged in ascending order based on ascii value.
2. the function first initializes an empty string `out` to store the final ordered version of the input string.
3. it then initializes an empty string `current` to store the characters of the current word being processed.
4. the function iterates through each character of the input string `s`.
5. if the character is a space, it means the current word has ended, so the characters in `current` are sorted in ascending order and appended to the `out` string.
6. if the character is not a space, it is part of the current word, so it is appended to the `current` string.
7. finally, the function returns the ordered version of the input string.
