1. the `split_words` function takes a string as input and splits it based on whitespace or comma.
2. if no whitespace or comma is found, it counts the number of lowercase letters with an odd order in the alphabet.
3. the function returns a vector of strings or a vector with one element (the count of odd-order lowercase letters).

1. the `split_words` function takes a string as input and splits it based on whitespace or commas. if neither is found, it counts the number of lowercase letters with an odd order in the alphabet.
2. the function first checks if there is a whitespace in the input string, if so, it splits the string based on whitespace.
3. if no whitespace is found, it checks for commas and splits the string based on commas.
4. if neither whitespace nor commas are found, it counts the number of lowercase letters with an odd order in the alphabet.
5. the function returns a vector of strings or a vector with one element (the count of lowercase odd letters).

1. the `split_words` function takes a string as input and splits it based on whitespace or comma. if neither whitespace nor comma is found, it counts the number of lowercase letters with an odd order in the alphabet and returns it as a string in a vector.
2. the function first checks for whitespace, then for comma, and finally counts the odd-order lowercase letters.
3. the assertion statement is comparing the output of `split_words(""hello world,!"")` with `{""hello"",""world,!""}`.

2. the function first checks for whitespace, then comma, and finally counts the number of lowercase letters with an odd order in the alphabet.
3. the function returns a vector of strings based on the splitting criteria.

"assert (issame(split_words(""abcdef"") , {""3""}));",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `split_words` function takes a string as input and splits it based on whitespace or comma. if neither whitespace nor comma is found, it counts the number of lowercase letters with an odd order in the alphabet.
2. for the given assertion, the input string is ""abcdef"". since there are no whitespaces or commas in the string, the function should count the number of lowercase letters with an odd order in the alphabet, which in this case is 3 (""c"", ""e"", ""a"").
3. the expected output vector should contain a single element which is the count of such letters, i.e., {""3""}.

"assert (issame(split_words(""aaabb"") , {""2""}));",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `split_words` function takes a string as input and splits it based on whitespace or comma. if neither whitespace nor comma is found, it counts the number of lowercase letters with an odd order in the alphabet.
2. the given assertion statement calls the `split_words` function with the input ""aaabb"" and expects the output to be a vector containing the string ""2"".

### pass/fail result

"assert (issame(split_words(""aaaBb"") , {""1""}));",fail,"### thinking process
1. the `split_words` function takes a string as input and splits it based on whitespace or comma. if neither whitespace nor comma is found, it counts the number of lowercase letters with an odd order in the alphabet.
2. the given assertion statement calls the `split_words` function with the input ""aaabb"" and expects the output to be {""1""}.
3. the input ""aaabb"" contains 2 lowercase letters with odd order in the alphabet (a=0, b=1).
4. therefore, the expected output should be {""2""} instead of {""1""}.

"assert (issame(split_words("""") ,{""0""}));",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `split_words` function takes a string as input and splits it based on whitespace or comma. if neither whitespace nor comma is found, it counts the number of lowercase letters with an odd order in the alphabet.
2. for the given assertion, the input string is empty, so the function should return a vector with one element, which is the count of lowercase letters with odd order in the alphabet. since the input is empty, the count should be 0.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
