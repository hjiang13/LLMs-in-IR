"assert (encrypt(""hi"") == ""lm"");",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `encrypt` function takes a string as input and encrypts it by rotating the alphabet down by two multiplied to two places.
2. the encryption logic is implemented by shifting each character in the input string by 4 positions.
3. the logic wraps around the alphabet by using modulo 26.
4. the encrypted string is built character by character and returned as the output.

1. the `encrypt` function takes a string as input and encrypts it by rotating the alphabet down by two multiplied to two places.
2. the function iterates through each character of the input string, calculates the new encrypted character based on the rotation logic, and appends it to the output string.
3. the rotation logic involves converting the character to its ascii value, shifting it down by 4 (to handle the two multiplied to two places rotation), and then converting it back to a character.
4. the output string is returned as the encrypted result.
