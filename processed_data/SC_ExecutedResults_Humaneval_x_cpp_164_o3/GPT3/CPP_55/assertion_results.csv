assert (fib(10) == 55);,pass,"### thinking process
1. the given c/c++ code defines a function `fib` that calculates the n-th fibonacci number using an array to store intermediate results.
2. the function initializes the first two fibonacci numbers in the array and then iterates to calculate subsequent fibonacci numbers.
3. the function returns the n-th fibonacci number.
4. the assertion statement checks if calling `fib(10)` returns 55, which is the 10th fibonacci number.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (fib(1) == 1);,pass,"### thinking process
1. the given c/c++ code defines a function `fib` that calculates the n-th fibonacci number using an array to store the fibonacci sequence.
2. the function initializes the first two elements of the array `f` to 0 and 1 respectively.
3. it then iterates from index 2 to n, calculating each fibonacci number based on the previous two numbers in the sequence.
4. the function returns the n-th fibonacci number.
5. the assertion statement checks if calling `fib(1)` returns 1.

1. the given c/c++ code defines a function `fib` that calculates the n-th fibonacci number using an array to store the fibonacci sequence.
2. the function initializes the first two elements of the array `f` as 0 and 1 respectively.
3. it then iterates from index 2 to n, calculating each fibonacci number by adding the previous two numbers in the sequence.
4. finally, it returns the n-th fibonacci number.
