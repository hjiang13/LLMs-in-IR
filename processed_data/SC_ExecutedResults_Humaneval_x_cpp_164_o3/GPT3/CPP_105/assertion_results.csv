"assert (issame(by_length({2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3}) , {""Eight"", ""Five"", ""Four"", ""Three"", ""Two"", ""Two"", ""One"", ""One""}));",pass,"### thinking process
1. the function `by_length` takes a vector of integers, sorts the integers between 1 and 9, reverses the vector, and replaces each digit with its corresponding name.
2. the function uses a map to store the mapping of integers to their corresponding names.
3. it sorts the input vector, filters out numbers outside the range 1-9, and then replaces them with their names.
4. the output vector is returned.

"assert (issame(by_length({}) , {}));",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `by_length` function takes a vector of integers, sorts them, filters out the numbers between 1 and 9 inclusive, replaces them with their corresponding names, and returns a vector of strings.
2. the assertion statement is checking if calling the `by_length` function with an empty vector returns an empty vector as expected.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(by_length({1, -1 , 55}) , {""One""}));",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `by_length` function takes a vector of integers, sorts the integers between 1 and 9 inclusive, reverses the resulting vector, and replaces each digit by its corresponding name.
2. in the given assertion, the input vector is {1, -1, 55}.
3. the vector after sorting and reversing will be {55, 1, -1}.
4. the function should return {""one""} as the output.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"

1. the `by_length` function takes a vector of integers, sorts them, filters out numbers between 1 and 9, reverses the resulting vector, and replaces each digit with its corresponding name.
2. the assertion statement is checking if the output of `by_length({1, -1, 3, 2})` matches `{""three"", ""two"", ""one""}`.

### pass/fail result
- **assertion result**: **fail**"
"assert (issame(by_length({9, 4, 8}) , {""Nine"", ""Eight"", ""Four""}));",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `by_length` function takes a vector of integers, sorts them, reverses them, and replaces each digit with its corresponding name from ""one"" to ""nine"".
2. the function ignores any numbers outside the range of 1 to 9.
3. we need to check if the function correctly sorts, reverses, and replaces the digits as described.

### assertion result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
