1. the `add_elements` function takes a vector of integers `arr` and an integer `k` as input.
2. it iterates over the first `k` elements of the vector and checks if each element has at most two digits (-99 to 99).
3. if the condition is met, it adds the element to the `sum`.
4. finally, it returns the `sum`.

### assertion result
