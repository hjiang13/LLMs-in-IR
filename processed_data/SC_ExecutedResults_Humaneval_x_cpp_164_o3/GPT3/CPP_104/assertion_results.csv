1. the `unique_digits` function takes a vector of positive integers and returns a sorted vector of elements that do not have any even digit.
2. it iterates through each number in the input vector, checks if it has any even digit, and if not, adds it to the output vector.
3. the output vector is then sorted in increasing order before being returned.
4. the assertion statement checks if the output of `unique_digits({15, 33, 1422, 1})` matches the expected vector `{1, 15, 33}`.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
