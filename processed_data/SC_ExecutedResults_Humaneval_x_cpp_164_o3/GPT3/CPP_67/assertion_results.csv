1. the `fruit_distribution` function takes a string `s` and an integer `n` as input.
2. it extracts the numbers from the string `s` which represent the number of apples and oranges.
3. it calculates the number of mango fruits in the basket by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits `n`.
4. the function returns the calculated result.
