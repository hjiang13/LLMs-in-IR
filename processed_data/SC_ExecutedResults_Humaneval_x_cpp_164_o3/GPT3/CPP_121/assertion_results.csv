1. the `solutions` function takes a vector of integers as input and returns the sum of all odd elements that are in even positions.
2. the function iterates through the vector and checks if the element at even position is odd (by checking if `lst[i*2] % 2 == 1`).
3. if the condition is true, it adds the element to the `sum`.
4. the function then returns the final `sum`.

1. the given function `solutions` takes a vector of integers as input and returns the sum of all odd elements that are in even positions.
2. the function iterates through the vector and checks if the element at even position is odd (using the condition `lst[i*2]%2==1`).
3. if the condition is true, it adds the element to the sum.
4. finally, it returns the sum.

### assertion result
- **assertion result**: **fail** 

### explanation
the assertion fails because the code logic is incorrect. the condition `lst[i*2]%2==1` checks if the element at even position is odd, but it should be checking if the element at even position is odd and not the position itself. the correct condition should be `lst[i*2]%2==1 && i*2 % 2 == 0` to ensure that we are checking for odd elements at even positions."

### assertion result
- **assertion result**: **fail** 

### explanation
- for the input vector `{30, 13, 23, 32}`, the function should return the sum of odd elements at even positions, which are `13` and `23`.
- however, the current implementation of the function only considers the element at index `0` and checks if it is odd, which is incorrect.
- the correct implementation should iterate through the vector with a step of `2` to consider elements at even positions.
- therefore, the assertion fails as the function does not return the expected result."
