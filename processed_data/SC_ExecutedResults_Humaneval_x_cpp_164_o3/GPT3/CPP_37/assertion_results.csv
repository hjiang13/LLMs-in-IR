"assert (issame(sort_even({1, 2, 3}), {1, 2, 3}));",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `sort_even` function takes a vector of floats as input and returns a new vector based on the given conditions.
2. the function extracts the even indices from the input vector, sorts them, and then constructs the output vector based on the sorting and original values.
3. we need to check if the function `sort_even` works correctly based on the provided assertion statement.

### assertion result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(sort_even({5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10}) , {-10, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 5, 0, 9, 1, 123}));",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `sort_even` function takes a vector `l` and creates a new vector `out`.
2. it extracts the even indices values from `l` and sorts them in the `even` vector.
3. then, it iterates over the original vector `l` and populates the `out` vector based on whether the index is even or odd.
4. the function returns the `out` vector.

1. the `sort_even` function takes a vector as input and returns a modified vector based on the given logic.
2. it extracts the even indices values from the input vector, sorts them, and then reconstructs the output vector by placing the sorted even indices values and the odd indices values from the input vector alternatively.
3. the provided assertion statement tests the function with a specific input vector and expects a specific output vector.
