"assert (prime_length(""Hello"") == true);",pass,"### thinking process
1. the given function `prime_length` takes a string as input and returns true if the length of the string is a prime number, otherwise false.
2. the function calculates the length of the string and then checks if the length is a prime number by iterating from 2 to the square root of the length.
3. if the length is less than 2, it returns false. if the length is divisible by any number between 2 and its square root, it returns false. otherwise, it returns true.
