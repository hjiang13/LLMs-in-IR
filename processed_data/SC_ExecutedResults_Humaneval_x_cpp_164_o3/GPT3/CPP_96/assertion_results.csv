"assert (issame(count_up_to(5) , {2,3}));",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `count_up_to` function takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns a vector of the first `n` prime numbers less than `n`.
2. the function starts from 2 and iterates up to `n-1` to check for prime numbers.
3. it uses a nested loop to check if the number is divisible by any of the previously found prime numbers.
4. if a number is not divisible by any of the previously found prime numbers, it is considered a prime number and added to the output vector.
5. the function returns the vector of prime numbers.

"assert (issame(count_up_to(1) , {}));",pass,"the given c/c++ code defines a function `count_up_to` that takes a non-negative integer `n` and returns a vector of the first `n` prime numbers less than `n`.

the function starts by initializing an empty vector `out`. it then iterates from 2 to `n-1` and checks if the number is prime by dividing it by all the previously found prime numbers in the `out` vector. if the number is prime, it is added to the `out` vector.

### assertion result
- **assertion result**: **pass** 

the assertion `assert (issame(count_up_to(1) , {}));` passes because the function correctly returns an empty vector when `n=1`."
