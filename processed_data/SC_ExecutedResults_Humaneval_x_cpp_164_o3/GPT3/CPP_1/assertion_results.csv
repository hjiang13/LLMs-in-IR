1. the `separate_paren_groups` function takes a string input containing multiple groups of nested parentheses and separates them into individual strings.
2. it iterates through the input string character by character, keeping track of the level of nesting using a `level` variable.
3. when an opening parenthesis `(` is encountered, the level is incremented, and the character is added to the current group string.
4. when a closing parenthesis `)` is encountered, the level is decremented, and the character is added to the current group string. if the level reaches 0, the current group is complete and added to the vector of all groups.
5. the function returns a vector of strings containing the separated groups of parentheses.

1. the `separate_paren_groups` function takes a string as input and separates the groups of nested parentheses into separate strings.
2. it iterates through the input string character by character, keeping track of the level of nesting.
3. when it encounters an opening parenthesis '(', it increments the level and adds the character to the current group string.
4. when it encounters a closing parenthesis ')', it decrements the level and adds the character to the current group string.
5. if the level reaches 0, it means the current group is complete, so it adds the current group string to the vector of all groups and resets the current group string.
6. the function returns the vector of separated groups.
