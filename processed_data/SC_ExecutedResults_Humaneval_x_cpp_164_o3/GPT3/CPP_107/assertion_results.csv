"assert (issame(even_odd_palindrome(123) , {8, 13}));",fail,"### thinking process
1. the given c/c++ code defines a function `even_odd_palindrome` that takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns a vector containing the count of even and odd integer palindromes within the range (1, n).
2. the function iterates from 1 to `n`, checks if the number is a palindrome, and then checks if it is even or odd to update the counts accordingly.
3. the function returns a vector with the count of even and odd palindromes.
4. the assertion statement checks if the output of `even_odd_palindrome(123)` matches the expected vector `{8, 13}`.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **fail**"

1. the given function `even_odd_palindrome` takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns a vector containing the count of even and odd integer palindromes within the range (1, n).
2. the function iterates from 1 to n, converts each number to a string, checks if it is a palindrome, and then checks if it is even or odd.
3. it increments the count of even and odd palindromes accordingly.
