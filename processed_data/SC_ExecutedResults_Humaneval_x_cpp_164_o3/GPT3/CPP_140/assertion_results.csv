"assert (fix_spaces(""Example"") == ""Example"");",pass,"### thinking process
1. the `fix_spaces` function iterates through the input string `text` character by character.
2. it counts the number of consecutive spaces encountered.
3. based on the number of consecutive spaces, it replaces them with underscores or hyphens accordingly.
4. the function then returns the modified string.

"assert (fix_spaces(""Mudasir Hanif "") == ""Mudasir_Hanif_"");",fail,"### thinking process
1. the `fix_spaces` function takes a string as input and replaces spaces with underscores. if there are more than 2 consecutive spaces, it replaces them with a single hyphen.
2. the function iterates through the input string character by character and keeps track of the number of consecutive spaces.
3. based on the number of consecutive spaces, it appends the appropriate character to the output string.
4. finally, it returns the modified string.

"assert (fix_spaces(""Yellow Yellow  Dirty  Fellow"") == ""Yellow_Yellow__Dirty__Fellow"");",fail,"### thinking process
1. the `fix_spaces` function iterates through the input string `text` character by character.
2. it keeps track of the number of consecutive spaces encountered in the `spacelen` variable.
3. based on the value of `spacelen`, it replaces spaces with underscores or hyphens accordingly.
4. the function returns the modified string.

### assertion result
- **assertion result**: **fail** 

### explanation
the expected output for the input ""yellow yellow  dirty  fellow"" is ""yellow_yellow__dirty__fellow"", but the actual output from the `fix_spaces` function is ""yellow_yellow__dirty_fellow"". the function does not correctly replace the consecutive spaces with hyphens as expected."
"assert (fix_spaces(""Exa   mple"") == ""Exa-mple"");",fail,"### thinking process
1. the `fix_spaces` function is supposed to replace spaces in the input string with underscores and handle consecutive spaces based on the given conditions.
2. the function iterates through the input string character by character and replaces spaces accordingly.
3. it keeps track of the length of consecutive spaces encountered.
4. after processing each character, it appends the appropriate replacement to the output string.
5. finally, it returns the modified string.

"assert (fix_spaces(""   Exa 1 2 2 mple"") == ""-Exa_1_2_2_mple"");",fail,"### thinking process
1. the `fix_spaces` function iterates through the input string `text` character by character.
2. it keeps track of the number of consecutive spaces encountered in the `spacelen` variable.
3. based on the value of `spacelen`, it replaces spaces with underscores or hyphens accordingly.
4. the function returns the modified string.

### assertion result
- **assertion result**: **fail** 

### explanation
the expected output for the input ""   exa 1 2 2 mple"" should be ""-exa_1_2_2_mple"" according to the provided code logic. however, the actual output from the `fix_spaces` function for this input is ""exa_1_2_2_mple"". the function is not correctly handling the consecutive spaces as per the requirement."
