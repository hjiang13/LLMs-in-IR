assert (truncate_number(3.5) == 0.5);,pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the function `truncate_number` and see how it works.

the function takes a floating point number as input and returns the decimal part of the number. it does this by subtracting the integer part of the number from the original number. the integer part is obtained using the `int()` function, which truncates the decimal part and returns the integer value.

now let's evaluate the assertion:

```cpp
assert (truncate_number(3.5) == 0.5);
```

we need to find the result of `truncate_number(3.5)`:

1. the input number is 3.5.
2. the integer part of 3.5 is obtained using `int(3.5)`, which returns 3.
3. the function returns `3.5 - 3`, which is equal to 0.5.

so, `truncate_number(3.5)` returns 0.5. now let's compare this result with the expected value in the assertion:

```cpp
0.5 == 0.5
```

the condition is true, so the assertion passes.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (abs(truncate_number(1.33) - 0.33) < 1e-4);,pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's first understand the code and the truncate_number function.

the truncate_number function takes a positive floating point number as input and returns the decimal part of the number. it does this by subtracting the integer part of the number (obtained using the int(number) typecasting) from the original number.

now let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (abs(truncate_number(1.33) - 0.33) < 1e-4);
```

the assertion is checking if the absolute difference between the result of truncate_number(1.33) and 0.33 is less than 1e-4 (0.0001). in other words, it is checking if the result of truncate_number(1.33) is close enough to the expected value of 0.33.

let's calculate the result of truncate_number(1.33):

truncate_number(1.33) = 1.33 - int(1.33) = 1.33 - 1 = 0.33

now let's calculate the absolute difference between the result and the expected value:

abs(truncate_number(1.33) - 0.33) = abs(0.33 - 0.33) = 0

since 0 is less than 1e-4, the assertion passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (abs(truncate_number(123.456) - 0.456) < 1e-4);,pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's first understand the given code and the function `truncate_number`.

the function `truncate_number` takes a floating-point number as input and returns the decimal part of the number. it does this by subtracting the integer part of the number from the original number. the integer part is obtained using the `int()` function, which truncates the decimal part and returns the integer part.

now let's evaluate the assertion statement:

```
assert (abs(truncate_number(123.456) - 0.456) < 1e-4);
```

1. first, the `truncate_number` function is called with the argument `123.456`. the function returns the decimal part of the number, which is `0.456`.
2. the returned value is then subtracted from `0.456`, resulting in `0`.
3. the `abs()` function is applied to the result, which returns the absolute value of the input. in this case, the input is `0`, so the output is also `0`.
4. finally, the assertion checks if the result is less than `1e-4`. since `0` is less than `1e-4`, the assertion passes.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
