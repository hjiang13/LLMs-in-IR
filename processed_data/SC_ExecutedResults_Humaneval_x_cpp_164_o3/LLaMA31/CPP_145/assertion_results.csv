"assert (issame(order_by_points({1, 11, -1, -11, -12}) , {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}));",pass,"first, let's analyze the given c++ code to understand what it does. the function `order_by_points` takes a vector of integers and sorts it in ascending order according to the sum of their digits. if there are several items with a similar sum of their digits, they are ordered based on their index in the original vector.

now, let's go through the code step by step:

1. the function initializes an empty vector `sumdigit` to store the sum of digits for each number in the input vector `nums`.
2. it iterates through the input vector `nums` and calculates the sum of digits for each number. it uses the `to_string` function to convert the absolute value of the number to a string and then iterates through the string to calculate the sum of digits. if the original number is positive, it adds the first digit to the sum, otherwise, it subtracts the first digit from the sum.
3. after calculating the sum of digits for each number, the function sorts the input vector `nums` based on the sum of digits in ascending order. it uses a simple bubble sort algorithm to do this.
4. finally, the function returns the sorted vector `nums`.

now let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(order_by_points({1, 11, -1, -11, -12}) , {-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}));
```

the assertion checks if the result of `order_by_points({1, 11, -1, -11, -12})` is the same as `{-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}`. according to the problem description, the expected output for the input `{1, 11, -1, -11, -12}` is `{-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}`.

so, let's see if the function produces the expected output:

1. for the input `{1, 11, -1, -11, -12}`, the sum of digits for each number is `{1, 2, -1, -2, -3}`.
2. sorting the input vector based on the sum of digits in ascending order results in `{-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}`.

the function produces the expected output, so the assertion should pass.

```

we need to check if the output of `order_by_points({1234, 423, 463, 145, 2, 423, 423, 53, 6, 37, 3457, 3, 56, 0, 46})` is equal to `{0, 2, 3, 6, 53, 423, 423, 423, 1234, 145, 37, 46, 56, 463, 3457}`.

let's calculate the sum of digits for each number in the input vector:

- 1234 -> 1+2+3+4 = 10
- 423 -> 4+2+3 = 9
- 463 -> 4+6+3 = 13
- 145 -> 1+4+5 = 10
- 2 -> 2
- 423 -> 4+2+3 = 9
- 423 -> 4+2+3 = 9
- 53 -> 5+3 = 8
- 6 -> 6
- 37 -> 3+7 = 10
- 3457 -> 3+4+5+7 = 19
- 3 -> 3
- 56 -> 5+6 = 11
- 0 -> 0
- 46 -> 4+6 = 10

now let's sort the numbers based on their sum of digits and their original index:

- 0 (sum = 0, index = 14)
- 2 (sum = 2, index = 5)
- 3 (sum = 3, index = 12)
- 6 (sum = 6, index = 9)
- 53 (sum = 8, index = 8)
- 423 (sum = 9, index = 2)
- 423 (sum = 9, index = 6)
- 423 (sum = 9, index = 7)
- 1234 (sum = 10, index = 1)
- 145 (sum = 10, index = 4)
- 37 (sum = 10, index = 10)
- 46 (sum = 10, index = 15)
- 56 (sum = 11, index = 13)
- 463 (sum = 13, index = 3)
- 3457 (sum = 19, index = 11)

the sorted vector is `{0, 2, 3, 6, 53, 423, 423, 423, 1234, 145, 37, 46, 56, 463, 3457}`.

comparing this sorted vector with the expected output in the assertion statement, we can see that they are the same.

"assert (issame(order_by_points({}) , {}));",pass,"first, let's analyze the given c/c++ code for the function `order_by_points`.

the function takes a vector of integers as input and returns a sorted vector based on the sum of the digits of each integer. if there are several items with the same sum of digits, they are ordered based on their index in the original vector.

the function first calculates the sum of digits for each integer in the input vector and stores it in another vector called `sumdigit`. it then sorts both the `nums` and `sumdigit` vectors simultaneously based on the values in `sumdigit`. finally, it returns the sorted `nums` vector.

now, let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(order_by_points({}) , {}));
```

the assertion checks if the result of `order_by_points({})` is the same as an empty vector `{}`. since the input vector is empty, the function should return an empty vector.

based on the code analysis, the function should return an empty vector when given an empty vector as input. therefore, the assertion should pass.

```

to evaluate this assertion, we need to apply the `order_by_points` function to the input vector `{1, -11, -32, 43, 54, -98, 2, -3}` and compare the result with the expected output vector `{-3, -32, -98, -11, 1, 2, 43, 54}`.

1. apply the `order_by_points` function to the input vector:
   - the sum of digits for each number in the input vector is: `{1, -2, -5, 7, 9, -17, 2, -3}`
   - sorting the input vector according to the sum of digits and their original index gives: `{-3, -32, -98, -11, 1, 2, 43, 54}`

2. compare the result with the expected output vector:
   - the result from the `order_by_points` function is `{-3, -32, -98, -11, 1, 2, 43, 54}`
   - the expected output vector is `{-3, -32, -98, -11, 1, 2, 43, 54}`

since the result from the `order_by_points` function matches the expected output vector, the assertion passes.
