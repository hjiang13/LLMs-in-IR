"assert (file_name_check(""example.txt"") == ""Yes"");",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the function `file_name_check` step by step with the input ""example.txt"".

1. the length of the input string is 11, which is greater than 5, so it passes the first condition.
2. the first character of the input string is 'e', which is between 'a' and 'z', so it passes the second condition.
3. the last 4 characters of the input string are "".txt"", which is one of the allowed extensions, so it passes the third condition.
4. now, we iterate through the input string to count the number of digits and dots:
   - there are no digits in the input string, so the number of digits is 0, which is less than 3.
   - there is only one dot in the input string, so the number of dots is 1.
   this means the input string passes the fourth and fifth conditions as well.

since the input string ""example.txt"" passes all the conditions, the function `file_name_check` will return ""yes"". therefore, the assertion `assert (file_name_check(""example.txt"") == ""yes"");` will pass.

2. check if the first character is a letter from the latin alphabet. the first character is '1', which is not a letter, so the function returns ""no"".

since the function returns ""no"" for the input ""1example.dll"", the assertion `assert (file_name_check(""1example.dll"") == ""no"")` will pass.

1. check if the length of the file name is less than 5. in this case, the length is 10, so it passes this condition.
2. check if the first character is a letter from the latin alphabet. in this case, the first character is 's', so it passes this condition.
3. check if the last 4 characters of the file name are one of the allowed extensions ("".txt"", "".exe"", or "".dll""). in this case, the last 4 characters are "".asd"", which is not an allowed extension. so, the function will return ""no"" at this point.

since the function returns ""no"" for the input ""s1sdf3.asd"", the assertion `assert (file_name_check(""s1sdf3.asd"") == ""no"");` will pass.

"assert (file_name_check(""K.dll"") == ""Yes"");",pass,"first, let's analyze the given c/c++ code for the `file_name_check` function and understand the logic behind it. the function takes a string `file_name` as input and checks if it meets the conditions mentioned in the comments.

1. the function first checks if the length of the file name is less than 5 characters. if it is, it returns ""no"" because the file name would be too short to meet the conditions.
2. next, it checks if the first character of the file name is a letter from the latin alphabet ('a'-'z' and 'a'-'z'). if not, it returns ""no"".
3. then, it checks if the last 4 characters of the file name are one of the allowed extensions ("".txt"", "".exe"", or "".dll""). if not, it returns ""no"".
4. the function then iterates through the file name and counts the number of digits and dots in the file name.
5. if the number of digits is greater than 3 or the number of dots is not equal to 1, it returns ""no"".
6. if all conditions are met, the function returns ""yes"".

now let's analyze the given assertion statement:

```
assert (file_name_check(""k.dll"") == ""yes"");
```

in this case, the file name ""k.dll"" meets all the conditions mentioned in the comments:

- there are no digits in the file name.
- there is exactly one dot ""."" in the file name.
- the substring before the dot is not empty and starts with a letter from the latin alphabet ('k').
- the substring after the dot is one of the allowed extensions ("".dll"").

so, the function should return ""yes"" for the input ""k.dll"". therefore, the assertion statement is correct.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (file_name_check(""MY16FILE3.exe"") == ""Yes"");",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the function `file_name_check` step by step with the input ""my16file3.exe"".

1. the length of the input string is 13, which is greater than 5, so it passes the first condition.
2. the first character of the input string is 'm', which is between 'a' and 'z', so it passes the second condition.
3. the last 4 characters of the input string are "".exe"", which is one of the allowed extensions, so it passes the third condition.
4. now, let's count the digits and dots in the input string:
   - there are 3 digits: '1', '6', and '3'. so, the number of digits is not more than 3.
   - there is only 1 dot '.' in the input string.
   so, the input string passes the fourth condition as well.

since all the conditions are met, the function should return ""yes"" for the input ""my16file3.exe"".

"assert (file_name_check(""His12FILE94.exe"") == ""No"");",pass,"let's analyze the given c/c++ code and the assertion statement step by step.

1. the function `file_name_check` takes a string `file_name` as input and returns ""yes"" if the file's name is valid, and ""no"" otherwise.

2. the conditions for a valid file name are:
   - there should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
   - the file's name contains exactly one dot ""."".
   - the substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from the latin alphabet ('a'-'z' and 'a'-'z').
   - the substring after the dot should be one of these: {'txt"", ""exe"", ""dll""}

3. the assertion statement is `assert (file_name_check(""his12file94.exe"") == ""no"");`. this means that the test case expects the function to return ""no"" for the input ""his12file94.exe"".

4. let's check the given input against the conditions for a valid file name:
   - there are 4 digits in the file's name (1, 2, 9, and 4), which violates the first condition.
   - the file's name contains exactly one dot ""."".
   - the substring before the dot starts with a letter from the latin alphabet ('h').
   - the substring after the dot is ""exe"", which is one of the allowed extensions.

5. since the first condition is violated, the function should return ""no"" for the input ""his12file94.exe"".

6. the assertion statement expects the function to return ""no"" for this input, which matches our analysis.

### final result

"assert (file_name_check(""_Y.txt"") == ""No"");",pass,"the given assertion statement is `assert (file_name_check(""_y.txt"") == ""no"");`. let's analyze the `file_name_check` function step by step to see if the assertion passes or fails.

1. the function first checks if the length of the input string is less than 5. in this case, the length of ""_y.txt"" is 6, so it passes this condition.
2. next, it checks if the first character of the input string is a letter from the latin alphabet ('a'-'z' and 'a'-'z'). in this case, the first character is an underscore '_', which is not a letter from the latin alphabet. therefore, the function returns ""no"".
3. since the function returns ""no"", the assertion statement `assert (file_name_check(""_y.txt"") == ""no"")` is true.

2. the first character of the input string is `'?'`, which is not a letter from the latin alphabet ('a'-'z' and 'a'-'z'). therefore, the function should return ""no"".
3. since the function returns ""no"", we don't need to check the other conditions.

now let's check the assertion statement:

```
assert (file_name_check(""?areya.exe"") == ""no"");
```

the assertion expects the function to return ""no"" for the input `""?areya.exe""`. based on our analysis, the function does return ""no"" for this input. therefore, the assertion passes.

### final result

1. the length of the input string is 19, which is greater than 5, so it passes the first condition.
2. the first character of the input string is '/', which is not a letter from the latin alphabet ('a'-'z' and 'a'-'z'). therefore, the function should return ""no"" at this point.

2. the first character of the input string is 't', which is a lowercase letter, so it passes the second condition.
3. the last four characters of the input string are "".txt"", which is one of the allowed extensions, so it passes the third condition.

2. the first character of the input string is `#`, which is not a latin alphabet letter. therefore, the function should return ""no"".
3. since the function returns ""no"", we don't need to check the rest of the conditions.

now let's check the assertion statement:
