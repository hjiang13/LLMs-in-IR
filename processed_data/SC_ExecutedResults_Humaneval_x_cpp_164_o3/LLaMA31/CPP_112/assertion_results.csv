"assert (issame(reverse_delete(""abcde"",""ae"") , {""bcd"",""False""}));",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the function `reverse_delete` step by step with the given input strings s = ""abcde"" and c = ""ae"".

1. the function initializes an empty string `n`.
2. it iterates through each character in the string `s`:
   - for character 'a', it is found in string `c`, so it is not added to `n`.
   - for character 'b', it is not found in string `c`, so it is added to `n`. now, n = ""b"".
   - for character 'c', it is not found in string `c`, so it is added to `n`. now, n = ""bc"".
   - for character 'd', it is not found in string `c`, so it is added to `n`. now, n = ""bcd"".
   - for character 'e', it is found in string `c`, so it is not added to `n`.
3. after the loop, the string `n` is ""bcd"".
4. the length of `n` is not 0, so the function continues.
5. the function creates a string `w` which is the reverse of `n`. in this case, w = ""dcb"".
6. the function checks if `w` is equal to `n`. they are not equal, so it returns {n, ""false""} which is {""bcd"", ""false""}.

now let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(reverse_delete(""abcde"",""ae"") , {""bcd"",""false""}));
```

the function `reverse_delete(""abcde"",""ae"")` returns {""bcd"", ""false""} as we analyzed above. the assertion is checking if the result is the same as {""bcd"", ""false""}. since both are the same, the assertion passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(reverse_delete(""abcdef"", ""b"") , {""acdef"",""False""}));",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's first understand the given code and then evaluate the assertion statement.

1. the function `reverse_delete` takes two strings `s` and `c` as input.
2. it initializes an empty string `n`.
3. it iterates through each character in the string `s` and checks if the character is present in the string `c`.
4. if the character is not present in `c`, it appends the character to the string `n`.
5. after iterating through all the characters in `s`, if the length of `n` is 0, it returns `{n, ""true""}`.
6. otherwise, it creates a new string `w` which is the reverse of `n`.
7. if `w` is equal to `n`, it returns `{n, ""true""}`.
8. if `w` is not equal to `n`, it returns `{n, ""false""}`.

now let's evaluate the assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(reverse_delete(""abcdef"", ""b"") , {""acdef"",""false""}));
```

1. the function `reverse_delete` is called with arguments `""abcdef""` and `""b""`.
2. the function iterates through the characters in `""abcdef""` and removes the character `'b'` since it is present in the string `""b""`.
3. the resulting string `n` is `""acdef""`.
4. the reverse of `n` is `""fedca""`, which is not equal to `""acdef""`.
5. so, the function returns `{""acdef"", ""false""}`.

the assertion statement compares the result of the function call `reverse_delete(""abcdef"", ""b"")` with the expected output `{""acdef"", ""false""}`. since the function returns `{""acdef"", ""false""}`, the assertion passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(reverse_delete(""abcdedcba"",""ab"") , {""cdedc"",""True""}));",pass,"to analyze the given assertion, let's go through the `reverse_delete` function step by step with the provided input strings s = ""abcdedcba"" and c = ""ab"".

1. initialize an empty string `n`.
2. iterate through the characters of string `s`:
   - if the character is not found in string `c`, append it to string `n`.
3. after the loop, `n` will be ""cdedc"".
4. check if the length of `n` is 0. in this case, it's not, so we continue.
5. create a new string `w` with the reversed content of `n`. in this case, `w` will be ""cdedc"".
6. compare `w` and `n`. if they are equal, return `{n, ""true""}`. otherwise, return `{n, ""false""}`.

in this case, `w` and `n` are equal, so the function returns `{""cdedc"", ""true""}`.

now let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(reverse_delete(""abcdedcba"",""ab"") , {""cdedc"",""true""}));
```

the `issame` function is not defined in the provided code, but we can assume it checks if the two input vectors are the same. since the `reverse_delete` function returns `{""cdedc"", ""true""}` with the given input, the assertion statement should pass.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(reverse_delete(""dwik"",""w"") , {""dik"",""False""}));",pass,"first, let's go through the given c++ code and understand the logic of the `reverse_delete` function:

1. the function takes two strings `s` and `c` as input.
2. it initializes an empty string `n` to store the result after deleting characters from `s` that are present in `c`.
3. it iterates through each character in `s` and checks if the character is not present in `c` using the `find` function. if the character is not found in `c`, it appends the character to the result string `n`.
4. if the length of the resulting string `n` is 0, it means all characters in `s` were deleted, and the function returns `{n, ""true""}`.
5. it creates a new string `w` by reversing the characters in `n` using reverse iterators.
6. if the reversed string `w` is equal to the original string `n`, it means the result is a palindrome, and the function returns `{n, ""true""}`. otherwise, it returns `{n, ""false""}`.

now let's analyze the given assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(reverse_delete(""dwik"",""w"") , {""dik"",""false""}));
```

the assertion is checking if the result of calling `reverse_delete(""dwik"", ""w"")` is the same as `{""dik"", ""false""}`.

let's see what happens when we call `reverse_delete(""dwik"", ""w"")`:

1. the function iterates through each character in ""dwik"".
2. it finds that 'w' is present in the second string ""w"", so it skips this character.
3. the resulting string `n` after the iteration is ""dik"".
4. the length of `n` is not 0, so it proceeds to check if it's a palindrome.
5. the reversed string `w` is ""kid"", which is not equal to ""dik"".
6. the function returns `{""dik"", ""false""}`.

since the result of `reverse_delete(""dwik"", ""w"")` is `{""dik"", ""false""}`, the assertion statement is correct.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(reverse_delete(""a"",""a"") , {"""",""True""}));",pass,"### analysis

first, let's go through the function `reverse_delete` and understand what it does:

1. it takes two strings `s` and `c` as input.
2. it initializes an empty string `n`.
3. it iterates through the characters of string `s`. if the current character is not found in string `c`, it appends the character to string `n`.
4. if the length of string `n` is 0, it returns a vector containing the empty string `n` and ""true"".
5. it creates a new string `w` which is the reverse of string `n`.
6. if `w` is equal to `n`, it means `n` is a palindrome, so it returns a vector containing `n` and ""true"".
7. if `w` is not equal to `n`, it means `n` is not a palindrome, so it returns a vector containing `n` and ""false"".

now, let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(reverse_delete(""a"",""a"") , {"""",""true""}));
```

in this assertion, we are calling the `reverse_delete` function with `s = ""a""` and `c = ""a""`. since the only character in `s` is also in `c`, the resulting string `n` will be an empty string. according to the function, if the length of `n` is 0, it should return `{n, ""true""}`. so, the expected output is `{ """", ""true"" }`.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(reverse_delete(""abcdedcba"","""") , {""abcdedcba"",""True""}));",pass,"first, let's analyze the provided c/c++ code for the `reverse_delete` function:

1. the function takes two strings `s` and `c` as input.
2. it initializes an empty string `n`.
3. it iterates through each character in the string `s`.
4. if the current character is not found in the string `c`, it appends the character to the string `n`.
5. if the length of the resulting string `n` is 0, it returns a vector containing the empty string `n` and ""true"".
6. it creates a new string `w` by reversing the string `n`.
7. if the reversed string `w` is equal to the original string `n`, it returns a vector containing the string `n` and ""true"".
8. otherwise, it returns a vector containing the string `n` and ""false"".

now, let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(reverse_delete(""abcdedcba"","""") , {""abcdedcba"",""true""}));
```

the assertion is checking if the result of calling the `reverse_delete` function with the input strings ""abcdedcba"" and """" is equal to the vector containing the strings ""abcdedcba"" and ""true"".

let's see what happens when we call the `reverse_delete` function with these input strings:

1. the function iterates through each character in the string ""abcdedcba"".
2. since the string `c` is empty, all characters in the string `s` are appended to the string `n`.
3. the resulting string `n` is ""abcdedcba"".
4. the reversed string `w` is also ""abcdedcba"".
5. since the reversed string `w` is equal to the original string `n`, the function returns a vector containing the string ""abcdedcba"" and ""true"".

the result of the `reverse_delete` function is indeed equal to the vector containing the strings ""abcdedcba"" and ""true"". therefore, the assertion passes.

                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(reverse_delete(""abcdedcba"",""v"") , {""abcdedcba"",""True""}));",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the function `reverse_delete` step by step with the given input strings s = ""abcdedcba"" and c = ""v"".

1. we start with an empty string `n`.
2. we iterate through each character in the string `s`. since none of the characters in `s` are present in `c`, we append all the characters to the string `n`. so, after the loop, `n` will be ""abcdedcba"".
3. the length of `n` is not 0, so we continue to the next step.
4. we create a new string `w` which is the reverse of `n`. in this case, `w` will also be ""abcdedcba"".
5. we compare `w` and `n`. since they are equal, we return `{n, ""true""}` which is `{""abcdedcba"", ""true""}`.

now let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(reverse_delete(""abcdedcba"",""v"") , {""abcdedcba"",""true""}));
```

the function call `reverse_delete(""abcdedcba"", ""v"")` returns `{""abcdedcba"", ""true""}` as we calculated above. the assertion is checking if the result is the same as `{""abcdedcba"", ""true""}`.

since the result of the function call and the expected result in the assertion are the same, the assertion passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(reverse_delete(""vabba"",""v"") , {""abba"",""True""}));",pass,"first, let's analyze the given c/c++ code for the `reverse_delete` function:

1. the function takes two strings `s` and `c` as input.
2. it initializes an empty string `n`.
3. it iterates through each character in the string `s`.
4. if the current character is not found in the string `c`, it appends the character to the string `n`.
5. if the length of the resulting string `n` is 0, it returns a vector containing the empty string `n` and ""true"".
6. it creates a new string `w` which is the reverse of the string `n`.
7. if the strings `w` and `n` are equal, it returns a vector containing the string `n` and ""true"".
8. otherwise, it returns a vector containing the string `n` and ""false"".

now let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(reverse_delete(""vabba"",""v"") , {""abba"",""true""}));
```

the assertion is checking if the result of calling `reverse_delete(""vabba"", ""v"")` is the same as the vector `{""abba"", ""true""}`.

let's see what happens when we call `reverse_delete(""vabba"", ""v"")`:

1. the function iterates through the characters of the string ""vabba"".
2. it removes the character 'v' since it is present in the string ""v"".
3. the resulting string `n` is ""abba"".
4. the reverse of the string `n` is also ""abba"".
5. since the strings `w` and `n` are equal, the function returns `{""abba"", ""true""}`.

the result of the function call `reverse_delete(""vabba"", ""v"")` is indeed `{""abba"", ""true""}`, which matches the expected result in the assertion statement.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(reverse_delete(""mamma"", ""mia"") , {"""", ""True""}));",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's first understand the given code and the assertion statement.

the function `reverse_delete` takes two strings `s` and `c` as input. it deletes all the characters in `s` that are equal to any character in `c`. then, it checks if the resulting string is a palindrome or not. the function returns a vector containing the resulting string and ""true""/""false"" based on whether the string is a palindrome or not.

now let's analyze the given assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(reverse_delete(""mamma"", ""mia"") , {"""", ""true""}));
```

here, the function `reverse_delete` is called with the arguments ""mamma"" and ""mia"". the expected result is an empty string and ""true"".

let's go through the function step by step:

1. initialize an empty string `n`.
2. iterate through the characters of the string `s` (""mamma"").
3. for each character in `s`, check if it is present in `c` (""mia"").
4. if the character is not present in `c`, append it to the string `n`.

after going through all the characters in ""mamma"", we will have the following string `n`:

- ""m"" is in ""mia"", so it is not added to `n`.
- ""a"" is in ""mia"", so it is not added to `n`.
- ""m"" is in ""mia"", so it is not added to `n`.
- ""m"" is in ""mia"", so it is not added to `n`.
- ""a"" is in ""mia"", so it is not added to `n`.

so, the resulting string `n` is an empty string.

now, let's check if the string `n` is a palindrome:

- since the length of `n` is 0, the function returns `{n, ""true""}`.

the result of the function call `reverse_delete(""mamma"", ""mia"")` is `{"""", ""true""}`.

comparing this result with the expected result in the assertion statement, we can see that they are the same.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
