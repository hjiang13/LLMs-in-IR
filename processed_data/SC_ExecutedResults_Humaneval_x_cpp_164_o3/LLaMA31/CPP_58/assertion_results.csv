"assert (issame(common({1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5}, {5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121}) , {1, 5, 653}));",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the `common` function step by step with the given input vectors:

1. the function takes two vectors `l1` and `l2` as input.
2. it initializes an empty vector `out` to store the common elements.
3. it iterates through each element in `l1` and checks if it is not already present in `out` using `find(out.begin(),out.end(),l1[i])==out.end()`.
4. if the element is not in `out`, it checks if the element is present in `l2` using `find(l2.begin(),l2.end(),l1[i])!=l2.end()`.
5. if the element is present in both `l1` and `l2`, it is added to the `out` vector using `out.push_back(l1[i])`.
6. after iterating through all elements in `l1`, the `out` vector is sorted using `sort(out.begin(),out.end())`.
7. finally, the function returns the sorted `out` vector containing the common elements.

now let's analyze the assertion:

```
assert (issame(common({1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5}, {5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121}) , {1, 5, 653}));
```

the `common` function is called with the input vectors `{1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5}` and `{5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121}`. following the steps mentioned above, the output vector `out` will contain the elements `{1, 5, 653}` after sorting.

the assertion checks if the output of the `common` function is the same as the expected vector `{1, 5, 653}` using the `issame` function. since the output of the `common` function is indeed `{1, 5, 653}`, the assertion will pass.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(common({5, 3, 2, 8}, {3, 2}) , {2, 3}));",pass,"first, let's analyze the given c++ code for the `common` function. the function takes two vectors `l1` and `l2` as input and returns a sorted vector containing the unique common elements between the two input vectors.

here's the step-by-step process of the `common` function:

1. initialize an empty vector `out` to store the unique common elements.
2. iterate through each element in `l1`.
3. check if the current element of `l1` is not already present in the `out` vector.
4. if the current element of `l1` is found in `l2`, add it to the `out` vector.
5. sort the `out` vector in ascending order.
6. return the `out` vector.

now, let's analyze the assertion statement:

```cpp
assert(issame(common({5, 3, 2, 8}, {3, 2}), {2, 3}));
```

the assertion checks if the result of `common({5, 3, 2, 8}, {3, 2})` is the same as `{2, 3}`. to verify this, let's run the `common` function with the given input vectors:

1. `l1 = {5, 3, 2, 8}` and `l2 = {3, 2}`
2. the unique common elements between `l1` and `l2` are `2` and `3`.
3. the sorted output vector is `{2, 3}`.

since the output of the `common` function is `{2, 3}`, which is the same as the expected result in the assertion, the assertion will pass.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(common({4, 3, 2, 8}, {3, 2, 4}) , {2, 3, 4}));",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the `common` function step by step with the given input vectors:

1. `l1 = {4, 3, 2, 8}` and `l2 = {3, 2, 4}`

2. initialize an empty output vector `out = {}`

3. iterate through `l1` and check if each element is present in `l2` and not already in `out`:
   - `4` is in `l2` and not in `out`, so add it to `out`: `out = {4}`
   - `3` is in `l2` and not in `out`, so add it to `out`: `out = {4, 3}`
   - `2` is in `l2` and not in `out`, so add it to `out`: `out = {4, 3, 2}`
   - `8` is not in `l2`, so skip it

4. sort `out`: `out = {2, 3, 4}`

5. return `out`

now let's check the assertion:

```
assert (issame(common({4, 3, 2, 8}, {3, 2, 4}) , {2, 3, 4}));
```

the `common` function returns `{2, 3, 4}` for the given input vectors, which is the same as the expected output in the assertion. therefore, the assertion passes.

"assert (issame(common({4, 3, 2, 8}, {}) , {}));",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the `common` function step by step with the given input vectors:

1. `l1 = {4, 3, 2, 8}` and `l2 = {}`
2. initialize an empty vector `out = {}`
3. iterate through `l1`:
   - for `i = 0`, `l1[i] = 4`, check if `4` is in `out` (it's not) and if `4` is in `l2` (it's not). so, don't add `4` to `out`.
   - for `i = 1`, `l1[i] = 3`, check if `3` is in `out` (it's not) and if `3` is in `l2` (it's not). so, don't add `3` to `out`.
   - for `i = 2`, `l1[i] = 2`, check if `2` is in `out` (it's not) and if `2` is in `l2` (it's not). so, don't add `2` to `out`.
   - for `i = 3`, `l1[i] = 8`, check if `8` is in `out` (it's not) and if `8` is in `l2` (it's not). so, don't add `8` to `out`.
4. sort `out` (it's already sorted as it's empty).
5. return `out`, which is still an empty vector `{}`.

now let's analyze the assertion:

```
assert (issame(common({4, 3, 2, 8}, {}) , {}));
```

the `common` function returns an empty vector `{}` for the given input, and the assertion is comparing it with an empty vector `{}`. since both vectors are empty, they are considered the same.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
