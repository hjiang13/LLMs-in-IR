assert (sum_to_n(1) == 1);,pass,"to analyze the assertion, we need to first understand the code and then evaluate the assertion statement.

the given code is a simple c/c++ function named `sum_to_n` which calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n using the formula: `n*(n+1)/2`. this formula is derived from the arithmetic series sum formula.

now let's evaluate the assertion statement:

```
assert (sum_to_n(1) == 1);
```

in this assertion, we are calling the `sum_to_n` function with an input value of 1. according to the formula inside the function, the result should be:

```
1 * (1 + 1) / 2 = 1 * 2 / 2 = 1
```

so, the expected output of `sum_to_n(1)` is 1.

now let's compare this output with the assertion statement:

```
assert (1 == 1);
```

since both sides of the equality operator are the same, the assertion will pass.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (sum_to_n(6) == 21);,pass,"to analyze the assertion, we need to first understand the function `sum_to_n`. the function takes an integer `n` as input and calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to `n`. the formula used in the function is the arithmetic series formula: `n * (n + 1) / 2`.

now let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (sum_to_n(6) == 21);
```

we need to check if the result of `sum_to_n(6)` is equal to 21. to do this, we can substitute the value of `n` in the formula:

```
sum_to_n(6) = 6 * (6 + 1) / 2
            = 6 * 7 / 2
            = 42 / 2
            = 21
```

so, `sum_to_n(6)` returns 21. now let's check the assertion:

```
assert (21 == 21);
```

since both sides of the equality are the same, the assertion passes.

assert (sum_to_n(11) == 66);,pass,"to analyze the assertion, we need to understand the function `sum_to_n` and then evaluate the assertion statement.

the function `sum_to_n` calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n using the formula: `n * (n + 1) / 2`. this formula is derived from the arithmetic series sum formula.

now let's evaluate the assertion statement:

```

we need to find the value of `sum_to_n(11)`:

```
sum_to_n(11) = 11 * (11 + 1) / 2
             = 11 * 12 / 2
             = 132 / 2
             = 66

now we can compare the result with the assertion statement:

```
assert (66 == 66);

since both sides of the equality are the same, the assertion passes.

assert (sum_to_n(30) == 465);,pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's first understand the code and the function `sum_to_n`.

the function `sum_to_n` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of numbers from 1 to n. the formula used in the function is the arithmetic series sum formula: 

```
sum = n * (n + 1) / 2
```

now let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (sum_to_n(30) == 465);
```

this assertion is checking if the result of `sum_to_n(30)` is equal to 465. to verify this, we can plug in the value of `n` as 30 in the formula:

```
sum = 30 * (30 + 1) / 2
sum = 30 * 31 / 2
sum = 930 / 2
sum = 465
```

the result is indeed 465, which matches the expected value in the assertion.

assert (sum_to_n(100) == 5050);,pass,"to analyze the assertion, i will first understand the functionality of the provided c/c++ code and then evaluate the assertion statement.

the given function `sum_to_n` calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n using the formula `n*(n+1)/2`. this formula is derived from the arithmetic series sum formula, which is correct.

now, let's evaluate the assertion statement:

```
assert (sum_to_n(100) == 5050);
```

here, the assertion is checking if the result of `sum_to_n(100)` is equal to 5050. to verify this, i will calculate the result of `sum_to_n(100)` using the provided function:

```
sum_to_n(100) = 100 * (100 + 1) / 2
              = 100 * 101 / 2
              = 10100 / 2
              = 5050
```

as we can see, the result of `sum_to_n(100)` is indeed 5050. therefore, the assertion statement is correct, and the assertion will pass.
