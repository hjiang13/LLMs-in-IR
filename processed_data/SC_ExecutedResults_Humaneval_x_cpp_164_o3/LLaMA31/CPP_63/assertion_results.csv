assert (fibfib(2) == 1);,pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the code step by step.

1. the function `fibfib` takes an integer `n` as input.
2. it initializes an integer array `ff` of size 100.
3. it sets the first three elements of the array as follows:
   - `ff[0] = 0`
   - `ff[1] = 0`
   - `ff[2] = 1`
4. it then iterates from `i = 3` to `i = n` and calculates the value of `ff[i]` as the sum of the previous three elements in the array: `ff[i] = ff[i-1] + ff[i-2] + ff[i-3]`.
5. finally, it returns the value of `ff[n]`.

now let's evaluate the assertion:

```
assert (fibfib(2) == 1);
```

when we call `fibfib(2)`, the function will return `ff[2]`, which is initialized to `1`. so, the assertion is:

```
assert (1 == 1);
```

this assertion is true, so it passes.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"

when `n = 1`, the function returns `ff[1]`, which is initialized to `0`. so, `fibfib(1) == 0` is true.

assert (fibfib(5) == 4);,pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's first understand the code and the fibfib sequence.

the fibfib sequence is defined as follows:
- fibfib(0) == 0
- fibfib(1) == 0
- fibfib(2) == 1
- fibfib(n) == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3)

the provided code defines a function `fibfib` that calculates the n-th element of the fibfib sequence using an array `ff` to store the computed values. the function initializes the first three elements of the array with the base cases and then iterates from i=3 to n, calculating each element as the sum of the three previous elements.

now let's analyze the assertion:

```
assert (fibfib(5) == 4);
```

to check if the assertion passes or fails, we need to compute the value of `fibfib(5)`:

- fibfib(3) = fibfib(2) + fibfib(1) + fibfib(0) = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1
- fibfib(4) = fibfib(3) + fibfib(2) + fibfib(1) = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2
- fibfib(5) = fibfib(4) + fibfib(3) + fibfib(2) = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4

so, `fibfib(5)` is indeed equal to 4. therefore, the assertion passes.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (fibfib(8) == 24);,pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's first understand the code and the fibfib sequence.

the fibfib sequence is defined as follows:
- fibfib(0) == 0
- fibfib(1) == 0
- fibfib(2) == 1
- fibfib(n) == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3)

the given c/c++ code implements a function `fibfib` that computes the n-th element of the fibfib sequence using an array `ff` to store the computed values. the function initializes the first three elements of the array with the base cases of the sequence and then iterates from i=3 to n, calculating each element as the sum of the three previous elements.

now let's analyze the assertion statement `assert (fibfib(8) == 24)`:

1. calculate fibfib(8) using the given function:
   - ff[0] = 0
   - ff[1] = 0
   - ff[2] = 1
   - ff[3] = ff[2] + ff[1] + ff[0] = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1
   - ff[4] = ff[3] + ff[2] + ff[1] = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2
   - ff[5] = ff[4] + ff[3] + ff[2] = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4
   - ff[6] = ff[5] + ff[4] + ff[3] = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7
   - ff[7] = ff[6] + ff[5] + ff[4] = 7 + 4 + 2 = 13
   - ff[8] = ff[7] + ff[6] + ff[5] = 13 + 7 + 4 = 24

2. compare the result with the assertion statement:
   - the assertion statement expects fibfib(8) to be equal to 24.
   - from our calculation, we found that fibfib(8) is indeed equal to 24.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
assert (fibfib(10) == 81);,pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's first compute the value of fibfib(10) using the given function.

1. we have the base cases: ff[0] = 0, ff[1] = 0, ff[2] = 1
2. now, we can compute the values for i = 3 to 10 using the for loop in the function:
   - i = 3: ff[3] = ff[2] + ff[1] + ff[0] = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1
   - i = 4: ff[4] = ff[3] + ff[2] + ff[1] = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2
   - i = 5: ff[5] = ff[4] + ff[3] + ff[2] = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4
   - i = 6: ff[6] = ff[5] + ff[4] + ff[3] = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7
   - i = 7: ff[7] = ff[6] + ff[5] + ff[4] = 7 + 4 + 2 = 13
   - i = 8: ff[8] = ff[7] + ff[6] + ff[5] = 13 + 7 + 4 = 24
   - i = 9: ff[9] = ff[8] + ff[7] + ff[6] = 24 + 13 + 7 = 44
   - i = 10: ff[10] = ff[9] + ff[8] + ff[7] = 44 + 24 + 13 = 81

now that we have computed the value of fibfib(10), we can check the assertion:

```
assert (fibfib(10) == 81);
```

since fibfib(10) is indeed equal to 81, the assertion passes.

assert (fibfib(12) == 274);,pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's first compute the value of fibfib(12) using the given function.

1. the function initializes an integer array ff of size 100.
2. it sets the base cases: ff[0] = 0, ff[1] = 0, and ff[2] = 1.
3. it then iterates from i = 3 to i = n (in this case, n = 12) and computes the value of ff[i] as the sum of the previous three elements in the sequence (ff[i-1], ff[i-2], and ff[i-3]).
4. finally, it returns the value of ff[n].

let's compute the values for the fibfib sequence up to n = 12:

- fibfib(0) = 0
- fibfib(1) = 0
- fibfib(2) = 1
- fibfib(3) = 1 (0 + 0 + 1)
- fibfib(4) = 2 (1 + 1 + 0)

- fibfib(6) = 7 (4 + 2 + 1)
- fibfib(7) = 13 (7 + 4 + 2)
- fibfib(8) = 24 (13 + 7 + 4)

- fibfib(11) = 149 (81 + 44 + 24)
- fibfib(12) = 274 (149 + 81 + 44)

now let's check the assertion:

```
assert (fibfib(12) == 274);

since fibfib(12) is indeed equal to 274, the assertion passes.

assert (fibfib(14) == 927);,pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's first compute the value of fibfib(14) using the given function.

1. the function initializes an integer array ff of size 100.
2. it sets ff[0] = 0, ff[1] = 0, and ff[2] = 1.
3. it then iterates from i = 3 to i = n (in this case, n = 14) and calculates the value of ff[i] using the formula ff[i] = ff[i-1] + ff[i-2] + ff[i-3].

let's compute the values for i = 3 to i = 14:

- i = 3: ff[3] = ff[2] + ff[1] + ff[0] = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1
- i = 4: ff[4] = ff[3] + ff[2] + ff[1] = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2
- i = 5: ff[5] = ff[4] + ff[3] + ff[2] = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4

- i = 12: ff[12] = ff[11] + ff[10] + ff[9] = 149 + 81 + 44 = 274

- i = 14: ff[14] = ff[13] + ff[12] + ff[11] = 504 + 274 + 149 = 927

now we can check the assertion:

```
assert (fibfib(14) == 927);

since we computed that fibfib(14) is indeed equal to 927, the assertion passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
