"assert (issame(incr_list({}) , {}));",pass,"the given code defines a function `incr_list` that takes a vector of integers as input and returns a new vector with each element incremented by 1. the assertion statement checks if the result of calling `incr_list` with an empty vector is equal to an empty vector.

in this case, the assertion will pass because when the input vector is empty, the loop inside the `incr_list` function will not execute, and the function will return an empty vector.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(incr_list({3, 2, 1}) , {4, 3, 2}));",pass,"first, let's analyze the given c/c++ code for the `incr_list` function. the function takes a vector of integers as input and increments each element by 1. the function then returns the modified vector.

now, let's examine the assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(incr_list({3, 2, 1}) , {4, 3, 2}));
```

the assertion is checking if the result of `incr_list({3, 2, 1})` is the same as `{4, 3, 2}`. to determine if the assertion passes or fails, we need to apply the `incr_list` function to the input vector `{3, 2, 1}` and compare the result with the expected output `{4, 3, 2}`.

applying the `incr_list` function to the input vector `{3, 2, 1}`:

1. the function iterates through each element of the input vector.
2. for each element, it increments the value by 1.
3. the resulting vector is `{4, 3, 2}`.

comparing the result of `incr_list({3, 2, 1})` with the expected output `{4, 3, 2}`, we can see that they are the same.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(incr_list({5, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123}) , {6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124}));",pass,"first, let's analyze the given c/c++ code. the function incr_list takes a vector of integers as input and increments each element by 1. the function then returns the modified vector.

now, let's look at the assertion statement. it checks if the result of incr_list({5, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123}) is the same as the expected output {6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124}.

to verify this, we can manually compute the result of incr_list({5, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123}):

1. initialize the input vector: {5, 2, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123}
2. increment each element by 1: {6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124}
3. return the modified vector: {6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124}

comparing the computed result {6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124} with the expected output {6, 3, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124}, we can see that they are the same.
