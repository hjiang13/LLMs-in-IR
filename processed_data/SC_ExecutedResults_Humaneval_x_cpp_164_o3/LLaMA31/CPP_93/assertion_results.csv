"assert (encode(""TEST"") == ""tgst"");",pass,"first, let's analyze the given code and understand what it does. the `encode` function takes a string `message` as input and performs the following operations:

1. it initializes a string `vowels` containing all vowels (both uppercase and lowercase).
2. it initializes an empty string `out` to store the encoded message.
3. it iterates through each character `w` in the input `message`.
4. if the character is a lowercase letter, it converts it to uppercase by subtracting 32 from its ascii value.
5. if the character is an uppercase letter, it converts it to lowercase by adding 32 to its ascii value.
6. if the character is a vowel, it adds 2 to its ascii value, effectively replacing it with the letter that appears 2 places ahead in the english alphabet.
7. it appends the modified character to the `out` string.
8. finally, it returns the encoded message `out`.

now let's analyze the given assertion statement:

```
assert (encode(""test"") == ""tgst"");
```

we need to check if the `encode` function, when given the input ""test"", returns the output ""tgst"".

let's go through the `encode` function step by step with the input ""test"":

1. the input message is ""test"".
2. the vowels string is initialized as ""aeiouaeiou"".
3. the output string `out` is initialized as an empty string.
4. iterating through each character in ""test"":
   - 't' is an uppercase letter, so it's converted to lowercase 't'.
   - 't' is not a vowel, so it remains unchanged.
   - 'e' is an uppercase letter, so it's converted to lowercase 'e'.
   - 'e' is a vowel, so it's replaced with the letter 2 places ahead, which is 'g'.
   - 's' is an uppercase letter, so it's converted to lowercase 's'.
   - 's' is not a vowel, so it remains unchanged.
   - 't' is an uppercase letter, so it's converted to lowercase 't'.
   - 't' is not a vowel, so it remains unchanged.
5. the final output string `out` is ""tgst"".

the assertion statement checks if the output of `encode(""test"")` is equal to ""tgst"". since the output is indeed ""tgst"", the assertion passes.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (encode(""Mudasir"") == ""mWDCSKR"");",pass,"first, let's analyze the given code and understand what it does. the function `encode` takes a string `message` as input and performs the following operations:

7. it appends the modified character `w` to the `out` string.
8. finally, it returns the encoded message `out`.

now let's analyze the given assertion statement:

```
assert (encode(""mudasir"") == ""mwdcskr"");
```

to check if the assertion passes or fails, we need to apply the `encode` function to the input ""mudasir"" and compare the result with the expected output ""mwdcskr"".

1. 'm' is an uppercase letter, so it's converted to lowercase 'm'.
2. 'u' is a lowercase vowel, so it's replaced with 'w' (2 places ahead in the alphabet).
3. 'd' is a lowercase letter, so it's converted to uppercase 'd'.
4. 'a' is a lowercase vowel, so it's replaced with 'c' (2 places ahead in the alphabet).
5. 's' is a lowercase letter, so it's converted to uppercase 's'.
6. 'i' is a lowercase vowel, so it's replaced with 'k' (2 places ahead in the alphabet).
7. 'r' is a lowercase letter, so it's converted to uppercase 'r'.

the encoded message is ""mwdcskr"", which matches the expected output in the assertion statement.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (encode(""YES"") == ""ygs"");",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the `encode` function step by step with the input ""yes"".

1. initialize `vowels` with ""aeiouaeiou"" and an empty output string `out`.
2. iterate through each character in the input string ""yes"":
   - for the first character 'y':
     - it's uppercase, so change it to lowercase: 'y'
     - 'y' is not a vowel, so no further change is needed.
     - append 'y' to `out`: ""y""
   - for the second character 'e':
     - it's uppercase, so change it to lowercase: 'e'
     - 'e' is a vowel, so replace it with the letter 2 places ahead: 'g'
     - append 'g' to `out`: ""yg""
   - for the third character 's':
     - it's uppercase, so change it to lowercase: 's'
     - 's' is not a vowel, so no further change is needed.
     - append 's' to `out`: ""ygs""

3. the function returns ""ygs"".

now let's check the assertion:

```
assert (encode(""yes"") == ""ygs"");
```

the function `encode(""yes"")` returns ""ygs"", which is equal to the expected output ""ygs"". therefore, the assertion passes.

### final result

"assert (encode(""This is a message"") == ""tHKS KS C MGSSCGG"");",fail,"first, let's analyze the given code and understand the logic of the encode function:

1. the function takes a string `message` as input.
2. it initializes a string `vowels` containing all vowels (both uppercase and lowercase).
3. it initializes an empty string `out` to store the encoded message.
4. it iterates through each character `w` in the input `message`.

8. the modified character is appended to the `out` string.
9. finally, the function returns the encoded message `out`.

now let's analyze the given assertion statement:

```
assert (encode(""this is a message"") == ""thks ks c mgsscgg"");
```

we need to check if the output of the `encode` function with the input ""this is a message"" is equal to ""thks ks c mgsscgg"".

let's go through the input string ""this is a message"" character by character and apply the encoding logic:

- 't' -> 't'
- 'h' -> 'h'
- 'i' -> 'k' (vowel, so replaced with the letter 2 places ahead)
- 's' -> 's'
- ' ' -> ' ' (space remains unchanged)
- 'i' -> 'k' (vowel, so replaced with the letter 2 places ahead)
- 's' -> 's'
- ' ' -> ' ' (space remains unchanged)
- 'a' -> 'c' (vowel, so replaced with the letter 2 places ahead)
- ' ' -> ' ' (space remains unchanged)
- 'm' -> 'm'
- 'e' -> 'g' (vowel, so replaced with the letter 2 places ahead)
- 's' -> 's'
- 's' -> 's'
- 'a' -> 'c' (vowel, so replaced with the letter 2 places ahead)
- 'g' -> 'g'
- 'e' -> 'g' (vowel, so replaced with the letter 2 places ahead)

the encoded message is ""thks ks c mggscgg"".

comparing the encoded message with the expected output in the assertion statement:

```
""thks ks c mggscgg"" == ""thks ks c mgsscgg""
```

the encoded message does not match the expected output. therefore, the assertion fails.

### final result

we need to check if the output of the `encode` function with the input ""i dont know what to write"" is equal to ""k dqnt knqw whct tq wrktg"".

the encoded message is ""k dqnt knqw whct tq wrktg"", which matches the expected output in the assertion statement.
