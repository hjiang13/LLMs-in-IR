"assert (any_int(2, 3, 1)==true);",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the function `any_int` step by step with the given input values (2, 3, 1).

1. check if the input values are integers:
   - `round(2) == 2` -> true
   - `round(3) == 3` -> true
   - `round(1) == 1` -> true

2. check if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two:
   - `2 + 3 == 1` -> false
   - `2 + 1 == 3` -> true
   - `3 + 1 == 2` -> false

since one of the conditions in step 2 is true, the function returns `true`.

now let's evaluate the assertion statement:

```
assert (any_int(2, 3, 1)==true);
```

since `any_int(2, 3, 1)` returns `true`, the assertion statement is:

```
assert (true==true);
```

this assertion passes.

"assert (any_int(2.5, 2, 3)==false);",pass,"### analysis
first, let's go through the function `any_int` and understand its logic:

1. the function takes three floating-point numbers as input: `a`, `b`, and `c`.
2. it checks if each of the input numbers is an integer by comparing the number with its rounded value. if any of the numbers is not an integer, the function returns `false`.
3. if all the numbers are integers, the function checks if any one of them is equal to the sum of the other two. if this condition is satisfied, the function returns `true`.
4. if none of the above conditions are met, the function returns `false`.

now let's analyze the given assertion statement:

```
assert (any_int(2.5, 2, 3)==false);
```

in this assertion, we are calling the `any_int` function with the arguments `2.5`, `2`, and `3`. let's see what happens inside the function:

1. the function first checks if each of the input numbers is an integer:
   - for `a = 2.5`, `round(a) = 3`, which is not equal to `a`. so the function returns `false` at this point.
   - the function doesn't proceed further to check the other conditions since it has already returned `false`.

since the function returns `false`, the assertion statement is comparing `false == false`, which is true. therefore, the assertion passes.

the function `any_int` takes three floating-point numbers as input and checks if one of them is equal to the sum of the other two. it also checks if all the numbers are integers. if these conditions are met, it returns `true`, otherwise, it returns `false`.

the assertion statement is:
```
assert (any_int(1.5, 5, 3.5)==false);
```

let's analyze the function step by step with the given input values (1.5, 5, and 3.5):

1. check if all the numbers are integers:
   - `round(1.5) != 1.5` evaluates to `true`, so the function returns `false`. the other conditions are not checked because the function has already returned.

since the function returns `false`, the assertion statement is expected to be `true`.

"assert (any_int(2, 6, 2)==false);",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the function `any_int` step by step with the given input values (2, 6, 2).

1. check if the input values are integers:
    - round(2) == 2 -> true

    - round(2) == 2 -> true

2. check if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two:
    - 2 + 6 == 2 -> false
    - 2 + 2 == 6 -> false
    - 6 + 2 == 2 -> false

since none of the conditions in step 2 are true, the function will return `false`.

now let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (any_int(2, 6, 2)==false);
```

the function `any_int(2, 6, 2)` returns `false`, and the assertion statement is checking if it is equal to `false`. since both are false, the assertion will pass.

first, let's go through the code and understand the logic:

1. the function `any_int` takes three floating-point numbers as input: `a`, `b`, and `c`.
2. it checks if each of these numbers is an integer by comparing the number with its rounded value. if any of them are not integers, the function returns `false`.
3. if all the numbers are integers, the function checks if the sum of any two numbers is equal to the third number. if this condition is satisfied, the function returns `true`.
4. if none of the above conditions are met, the function returns `false`.

now let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (any_int(4, 2, 2)==true);
```

in this case, the function `any_int` is called with the arguments `4`, `2`, and `2`. since all the numbers are integers and `4` is equal to the sum of `2` and `2`, the function should return `true`. the assertion statement expects the function to return `true` as well.

### assertion statement

### evaluation
1. the assertion statement calls the `any_int` function with the arguments `2.2`, `2.2`, and `2.2`.
2. since all the input numbers are not integers, the function will return `false`.
3. the assertion statement expects the function to return `false`, which matches the actual return value.

"assert (any_int(-4, 6, 2)==true);",fail,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the function `any_int` with the given values:

1. the function takes three arguments: `a = -4`, `b = 6`, and `c = 2`.
2. check if all numbers are integers by comparing their rounded values with their original values:
   - `round(-4) == -4` (true)
   - `round(6) == 6` (true)
   - `round(2) == 2` (true)
3. since all numbers are integers, proceed to check if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two:
   - `-4 + 6 == 2` (false)
   - `-4 + 2 == 6` (false)
   - `6 + 2 == -4` (false)
4. none of the conditions are true, so the function returns `false`.

now let's evaluate the assertion:

```
assert (any_int(-4, 6, 2) == true);
```

since `any_int(-4, 6, 2)` returns `false`, the assertion is checking if `false == true`, which is not correct.
