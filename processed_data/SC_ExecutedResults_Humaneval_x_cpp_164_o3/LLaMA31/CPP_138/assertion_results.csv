assert (is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == false);,pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's first understand the given c/c++ code.

the function `is_equal_to_sum_even` takes an integer `n` as input and checks if it can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. the function returns `true` if the input number is even and greater than or equal to 8, otherwise, it returns `false`.

now, let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == false);
```

in this assertion, we are checking if the function `is_equal_to_sum_even` returns `false` when the input is 4.

since 4 is an even number but less than 8, the function should return `false`. so, the assertion is checking if the function behaves as expected.

in this assertion, we are calling the function `is_equal_to_sum_even` with the argument `6`. since 6 is an even number but less than 8, the function will return `false`. the assertion statement is checking if the function returns `false`, which it does. therefore, the assertion will pass.

assert (is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == true);,pass,"### analysis

the function `is_equal_to_sum_even` takes an integer `n` as input and checks if it can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. the function first checks if the input number is even and greater than or equal to 8. if both conditions are satisfied, the function returns `true`, otherwise, it returns `false`.

now let's analyze the given assertion statement:

```
assert (is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == true);
```

in this assertion, we are calling the `is_equal_to_sum_even` function with an input value of 8. since 8 is an even number and greater than or equal to 8, the function should return `true`. the assertion statement is checking if the function returns `true` for the input value 8.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**

the assertion passes because the function `is_equal_to_sum_even` correctly returns `true` for the input value 8, which can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers (2 + 2 + 2 + 2)."
assert (is_equal_to_sum_even(10) == true);,pass,"### analysis

first, let's understand the problem statement. we need to evaluate whether a given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. the function `is_equal_to_sum_even` takes an integer n as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the condition is satisfied or not.

now let's analyze the given c/c++ code:

1. the function checks if the input number n is even by using the modulo operator (n % 2 == 0). if n is odd, it cannot be written as the sum of 4 even numbers, so the function returns false.
2. if n is even, the function checks if it is greater than or equal to 8. this is because the smallest possible sum of 4 positive even numbers is 8 (2 + 2 + 2 + 2). if n is less than 8, it cannot be written as the sum of 4 positive even numbers, so the function returns false.
3. if both conditions are satisfied (n is even and greater than or equal to 8), the function returns true, indicating that n can be written as the sum of 4 positive even numbers.

now let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (is_equal_to_sum_even(10) == true);
```

the assertion is checking if the function `is_equal_to_sum_even` returns true when the input is 10. since 10 is an even number and greater than or equal to 8, the function should return true. therefore, the assertion should pass.

now let's analyze the given assertion:

```

in this assertion, we are calling the `is_equal_to_sum_even` function with the argument `11`. since 11 is an odd number, it cannot be written as the sum of 4 positive even numbers. therefore, the function should return `false`.

the assertion checks if the function returns `false` for the input `11`. since the function indeed returns `false`, the assertion will pass.
