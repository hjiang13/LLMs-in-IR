"assert (add({4, 88}) == 88);",pass,"first, let's analyze the given c/c++ code:

the function `add` takes a non-empty vector of integers `lst` as input. it initializes a variable `sum` to 0. then, it iterates through the vector using a for loop, where the index `i` is multiplied by 2 and added to 1, ensuring that only odd indices are considered. if the element at the odd index is even, it is added to the `sum`. finally, the function returns the `sum`.

now, let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (add({4, 88}) == 88);
```

the assertion statement is checking if the result of `add({4, 88})` is equal to 88.

let's go through the `add` function with the input `{4, 88}`:

1. initialize `sum` to 0.
2. the size of the input vector is 2, so the for loop will only run once with `i = 0`.
3. the index `i*2+1` is equal to 1, which is an odd index.
4. the element at index 1 is 88, which is even.
5. add 88 to `sum`, so `sum` becomes 88.
6. the loop ends, and the function returns `sum`, which is 88.

the result of `add({4, 88})` is 88, which is equal to the expected value in the assertion statement. therefore, the assertion passes.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (add({4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 122}) == 122);",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the function `add` step by step with the given input `{4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 122}`.

1. initialize `sum` to 0.
2. iterate through the vector using the index `i`:
   - when `i = 0`, the index `i*2+1` is 1, and `lst[1]` is 5. since 5 is not even, we don't add it to the sum.
   - when `i = 1`, the index `i*2+1` is 3, and `lst[3]` is 7. since 7 is not even, we don't add it to the sum.
   - when `i = 2`, the index `i*2+1` is 5, and `lst[5]` is 122. since 122 is even, we add it to the sum. now, `sum` is 122.
3. the loop ends because `i*2+1` is greater than or equal to the size of the vector.
4. the function returns the sum, which is 122.

now let's check the assertion:

```
assert (add({4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 122}) == 122);
```

the function `add` returns 122, and the assertion checks if it is equal to 122. since both values are equal, the assertion passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (add({4, 0, 6, 7}) == 0);",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's first understand the given code and the function `add`.

the function `add` takes a non-empty vector of integers `lst` as input. it initializes a variable `sum` to 0. then, it iterates through the vector using a for loop, where the index `i` is multiplied by 2 and added to 1 (i.e., `i*2+1`). this is done to access the elements at odd indices. inside the loop, it checks if the element at the odd index is even (i.e., divisible by 2). if it is, the element is added to the `sum`. finally, the function returns the `sum`.

now, let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (add({4, 0, 6, 7}) == 0);
```

here, the input vector is `{4, 0, 6, 7}`. let's go through the function step by step:

1. initialize `sum` to 0.
2. the loop will run for `i = 0` and `i = 1` because `i*2+1` will be less than the size of the vector (4) for these values of `i`.
3. for `i = 0`, the element at index `i*2+1` (1) is 0, which is even. so, add it to `sum`. now, `sum` is 0.
4. for `i = 1`, the element at index `i*2+1` (3) is 7, which is odd. so, it will not be added to `sum`.
5. the loop ends, and the function returns `sum`, which is 0.

the assertion statement checks if the result of `add({4, 0, 6, 7})` is equal to 0. since the function returns 0, the assertion passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (add({4, 4, 6, 8}) == 12);",pass,"in the given code, the function `add` takes a non-empty vector of integers and adds the even elements that are at odd indices.

let's analyze the code step by step:

1. initialize a variable `sum` to store the sum of even elements at odd indices.
2. loop through the vector using a for loop with the condition `i*2+1 < lst.size()`. this ensures that we only consider odd indices.
3. check if the element at the odd index `lst[i*2+1]` is even by using the condition `lst[i*2+1] % 2 == 0`.
4. if the element is even, add it to the `sum`.
5. return the `sum` after the loop ends.

now let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (add({4, 4, 6, 8}) == 12);
```

in this assertion, we are calling the `add` function with the vector `{4, 4, 6, 8}` and checking if the result is equal to 12.

let's go through the function with this input:

1. the odd indices in the vector are 1 and 3.
2. at index 1, the element is 4, which is even. so, we add it to the sum (sum = 0 + 4 = 4).
3. at index 3, the element is 8, which is also even. so, we add it to the sum (sum = 4 + 8 = 12).
4. the loop ends, and the function returns the sum, which is 12.

the assertion statement is checking if the result of the `add` function is equal to 12, which it is. therefore, the assertion passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
