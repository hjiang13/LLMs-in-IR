"assert (issame(sort_array({}) , {}));",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the `sort_array` function step by step with the given input and see if the output matches the expected result in the assertion.

input: `{}`
expected output: `{}`

1. the function checks if the size of the input array is 0. in this case, it is, so it returns an empty vector `{}`.

the output of the function is `{}`, which matches the expected output in the assertion.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(sort_array({5}) , {5}));",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the `sort_array` function step by step with the given input.

input: `sort_array({5})`

1. the size of the input array is not 0, so we continue to the next step.
2. the sum of the first and last index values is 5 + 5 = 10, which is even.
3. since the sum is even, we enter the else block.
4. inside the else block, we first sort the array in ascending order. after sorting, the array remains the same: `{5}`.
5. we then create a new vector `out` and iterate through the sorted array in reverse order, pushing each element into `out`. in this case, there is only one element, so `out` becomes `{5}`.
6. finally, we return the `out` vector, which is `{5}`.

now let's evaluate the assertion statement:

```
assert(issame(sort_array({5}), {5}));
```

the `sort_array({5})` function returns `{5}`, which is the same as the expected output `{5}`. therefore, the assertion passes.

1. the input vector is not empty, so we don't return an empty vector.
2. we calculate the sum of the first and last elements: `2 + 5 = 7`, which is odd.
3. since the sum is odd, we enter the first if block and sort the vector in ascending order.
4. after sorting, the vector becomes `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`.
5. we return the sorted vector.

now let's check the assertion:

```
assert(issame(sort_array({2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5}), {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}));
```

the `sort_array` function returns `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}` for the input `{2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5}`. the expected output is also `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`. since both the returned vector and the expected vector are the same, the assertion passes.

the assertion checks if the output of `sort_array({2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6})` is equal to `{6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0}`.

let's see what `sort_array({2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6})` returns:

"assert (issame(sort_array({2, 1}) , {1, 2}));",pass,"first, let's analyze the given c++ code for the `sort_array` function:

1. if the input vector is empty, it returns an empty vector.
2. if the sum of the first and last elements of the input vector is odd, it sorts the vector in ascending order and returns the sorted vector.
3. if the sum of the first and last elements of the input vector is even, it sorts the vector in ascending order, then reverses the sorted vector and returns the reversed vector.

now, let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(sort_array({2, 1}) , {1, 2}));
```

in this assertion, we are calling the `sort_array` function with the input vector `{2, 1}` and checking if the output is the same as `{1, 2}`.

let's go through the `sort_array` function step by step with the input vector `{2, 1}`:

1. the input vector is not empty, so we proceed to check the sum of the first and last elements.
2. the sum of the first and last elements is 2 + 1 = 3, which is odd.
3. since the sum is odd, the function sorts the input vector in ascending order, resulting in `{1, 2}`.
4. the sorted vector `{1, 2}` is returned.

now, let's compare the returned vector `{1, 2}` with the expected output `{1, 2}` in the assertion statement. since both vectors are the same, the assertion passes.

"assert (issame(sort_array({15, 42, 87, 32 ,11, 0}) , {0, 11, 15, 32, 42, 87}));",pass,"first, let's analyze the given c++ code for the `sort_array` function:

1. the function takes a vector of integers as input.

5. if the sum is even, it sorts the input vector in ascending order, then reverses the sorted vector and returns the reversed vector.

now let's evaluate the assertion statement:

1. the input vector is `{15, 42, 87, 32, 11, 0}`.
2. the sum of the first and last elements is 15 + 0 = 15, which is odd.
3. since the sum is odd, the function will sort the input vector in ascending order.
4. the sorted vector will be `{0, 11, 15, 32, 42, 87}`.

the expected output in the assertion statement is also `{0, 11, 15, 32, 42, 87}`. therefore, the assertion should pass.

"assert (issame(sort_array({21, 14, 23, 11}) , {23, 21, 14, 11}));",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's first understand the given c/c++ code and then evaluate the assertion statement.

### understanding the code

the `sort_array` function takes a vector of integers as input and returns a sorted copy of the input vector. the sorting order (ascending or descending) depends on the sum of the first and last elements of the input vector. if the sum is odd, the vector is sorted in ascending order; otherwise, it's sorted in descending order.

### evaluating the assertion

the assertion statement is:
```cpp
assert(issame(sort_array({21, 14, 23, 11}), {23, 21, 14, 11}));
```

let's break it down:

1. the input vector is `{21, 14, 23, 11}`.
2. the sum of the first and last elements is `21 + 11 = 32`, which is even.
3. since the sum is even, the vector should be sorted in descending order.
4. the expected output vector is `{23, 21, 14, 11}`.

now, let's see if the `sort_array` function produces the expected output:

1. the function first sorts the input vector in ascending order: `{11, 14, 21, 23}`.
2. since the sum of the first and last elements is even, the function reverses the sorted vector to produce the output: `{23, 21, 14, 11}`.

the output of the `sort_array` function matches the expected output in the assertion statement.

### final result

- **assertion result**: **pass**"
