"assert (hex_key(""AB"") == 1      );",pass,"### analysis
the given function `hex_key` takes a string `num` as input, which represents a hexadecimal number. the function counts the number of hexadecimal digits in the input string that are prime numbers. the prime numbers in hexadecimal are 2, 3, 5, 7, b (11 in decimal), and d (13 in decimal).

the function uses a string `key` containing the prime hexadecimal digits and iterates through each character in the input string `num`. if the current character is found in the `key` string, the count `out` is incremented.

### assertion statement
```
assert (hex_key(""ab"") == 1);
```

in this assertion, we are testing if the function `hex_key` returns the correct count of prime hexadecimal digits for the input string ""ab"". the input string ""ab"" contains only one prime hexadecimal digit, which is 'b'. therefore, the expected output is 1.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**

the assertion passes because the function `hex_key` correctly counts the number of prime hexadecimal digits in the input string ""ab"" and returns the expected output of 1."
"assert (hex_key(""1077E"") == 2 );",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's first understand the given code and the function `hex_key`.

the function `hex_key` takes a string `num` as input, which represents a hexadecimal number. the function counts the number of hexadecimal digits in the input string that are prime numbers. the prime numbers in hexadecimal are 2, 3, 5, 7, b (11 in decimal), and d (13 in decimal).

the function uses a string `key` containing the prime hexadecimal digits and iterates through each character in the input string `num`. if the character is found in the `key` string, the count `out` is incremented.

now, let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (hex_key(""1077e"") == 2 );
```

the assertion is checking if the function `hex_key` returns 2 when given the input string ""1077e"".

let's go through the input string ""1077e"" and count the prime hexadecimal digits:

1. '1' is not a prime hexadecimal digit.
2. '0' is not a prime hexadecimal digit.
3. '7' is a prime hexadecimal digit (count = 1).
4. '7' is a prime hexadecimal digit (count = 2).
5. 'e' is not a prime hexadecimal digit.

the function `hex_key` should return 2 for the input ""1077e"", as there are two prime hexadecimal digits (7 and 7).

now let's analyze the given assertion:

```
assert (hex_key(""abed1a33"") == 4);
```

the input string is ""abed1a33"". let's count the prime hexadecimal digits in this string:

- a is not a prime hexadecimal digit.
- b is a prime hexadecimal digit (11 in decimal).
- e is not a prime hexadecimal digit.
- d is a prime hexadecimal digit (13 in decimal).
- 1 is not a prime hexadecimal digit.
- a is not a prime hexadecimal digit.
- 3 is a prime hexadecimal digit.
- 3 is a prime hexadecimal digit.

there are 4 prime hexadecimal digits in the input string. so, the function `hex_key(""abed1a33"")` should return 4.

the assertion statement checks if the return value of `hex_key(""abed1a33"")` is equal to 4. since the function returns 4, the assertion passes.

"assert (hex_key(""2020"") == 2 );",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the `hex_key` function step by step.

1. the function takes a string `num` as input, which represents a hexadecimal number.
2. it initializes a string `key` containing the characters '2', '3', '5', '7', 'b', and 'd', which represent the prime numbers in hexadecimal.
3. it initializes an integer `out` to keep track of the count of prime hexadecimal digits in the input string.
4. it iterates through each character in the input string `num`.
5. for each character, it checks if the character is present in the `key` string using the `find` function from the `<algorithm>` library.
6. if the character is found in the `key` string, it increments the `out` counter.
7. finally, the function returns the value of `out`.

now, let's analyze the given assertion:

```
assert (hex_key(""2020"") == 2 );
```

the input string is ""2020"". let's go through the function with this input:

1. the function initializes `key` and `out`.
2. it iterates through the characters '2', '0', '2', and '0'.
3. for the first character '2', it finds it in the `key` string and increments `out` to 1.
4. for the second character '0', it doesn't find it in the `key` string and doesn't increment `out`.
5. for the third character '2', it finds it in the `key` string and increments `out` to 2.
6. for the fourth character '0', it doesn't find it in the `key` string and doesn't increment `out`.
7. the function returns the value of `out`, which is 2.

the assertion checks if the return value of `hex_key(""2020"")` is equal to 2. since the function returns 2, the assertion passes.

"assert (hex_key(""123456789ABCDEF0"") == 6      );",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the given code and understand the logic of the `hex_key` function.

1. the function `hex_key` takes a string `num` as input, which represents a hexadecimal number.
2. it initializes a string `key` with the characters ""2357bd"", which are the hexadecimal digits that correspond to prime numbers.
3. it initializes an integer `out` to 0, which will be used to count the number of prime hexadecimal digits in the input string.
4. the function iterates through each character in the input string `num`.
5. for each character, it checks if the character is present in the `key` string using the `find` function from the `<algorithm>` library.
6. if the character is found in the `key` string, it increments the `out` counter by 1.
7. after iterating through all the characters in the input string, the function returns the value of `out`, which represents the count of prime hexadecimal digits in the input string.

now let's analyze the given assertion statement:

```
assert (hex_key(""123456789abcdef0"") == 6      );
```

the assertion is checking if the `hex_key` function returns 6 when the input string is ""123456789abcdef0"". let's count the prime hexadecimal digits in the input string:

- '2' is a prime hexadecimal digit.
- '3' is a prime hexadecimal digit.
- '5' is a prime hexadecimal digit.
- '7' is a prime hexadecimal digit.
- 'b' is a prime hexadecimal digit (11 in decimal).
- 'd' is a prime hexadecimal digit (13 in decimal).

there are 6 prime hexadecimal digits in the input string, so the `hex_key` function should return 6. since the assertion is checking if the function returns 6, the assertion will pass.

now let's analyze the given assertion statement:

```
assert (hex_key(""112233445566778899aabbccddeeff00"") == 12 );
```

the assertion statement checks if the `hex_key` function returns 12 when given the input string ""112233445566778899aabbccddeeff00"".

let's count the prime hexadecimal digits in the input string:
- there are two 2's, two 3's, two 5's, two 7's, two b's, and two d's.
- in total, there are 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12 prime hexadecimal digits.

so, the `hex_key` function should return 12 for the given input string, and the assertion statement should pass.

to analyze this assertion, let's go through the `hex_key` function:

1. the function takes a string `num` as input.

7. finally, the function returns the value of `out`, which represents the count of prime hexadecimal digits in the input string.

now let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (hex_key("""") == 0);
