"assert (issame(even_odd_count(7) , {0, 1}));",pass,"first, let's analyze the given c/c++ code for the even_odd_count function:

1. the function takes an integer `num` as input.
2. it converts the absolute value of `num` to a string `w`.
3. it initializes two variables, `n1` and `n2`, to count odd and even digits respectively.
4. it iterates through each character in the string `w` and checks if the character is odd or even. if it's odd, it increments `n1`, otherwise, it increments `n2`.
5. finally, it returns a vector containing the counts of even and odd digits, `{n2, n1}`.

now, let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(even_odd_count(7) , {0, 1}));
```

the assertion is checking if the result of `even_odd_count(7)` is the same as the vector `{0, 1}`.

let's see what `even_odd_count(7)` returns:

1. the input is `7`.
2. the absolute value of `7` is `7`, so `w` is the string ""7"".
3. there's only one character in `w`, which is '7'. since '7' is odd, `n1` is incremented to 1, and `n2` remains 0.
4. the function returns the vector `{0, 1}`.

since `even_odd_count(7)` returns `{0, 1}`, the assertion statement is comparing `{0, 1}` with `{0, 1}`. these two vectors are the same, so the assertion passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(even_odd_count(-78) , {1, 1}));",pass,"### analysis

first, let's go through the provided c/c++ code to understand the logic of the `even_odd_count` function.

1. the function takes an integer `num` as input.
2. it converts the absolute value of `num` to a string `w`. this is done to iterate through each digit of the number.
3. it initializes two integer variables `n1` and `n2` to count odd and even digits respectively.
4. it iterates through each character in the string `w`:
   - if the character is odd (i.e., `w[i] % 2 == 1`), it increments `n1`.
   - otherwise, it increments `n2`.
5. finally, it returns a vector containing `n2` (even count) and `n1` (odd count).

now, let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(even_odd_count(-78) , {1, 1}));
```

the assertion is checking if the result of `even_odd_count(-78)` is the same as `{1, 1}`.

let's manually compute the expected result for `even_odd_count(-78)`:

1. the absolute value of -78 is 78.
2. the digits of 78 are 7 and 8.
3. 7 is odd, so `n1` (odd count) should be incremented to 1.
4. 8 is even, so `n2` (even count) should be incremented to 1.
5. the expected result is `{1, 1}`.

### final result

- **assertion result**: **pass**

the assertion passes because the expected result `{1, 1}` matches the actual result of `even_odd_count(-78)`."
"assert (issame(even_odd_count(3452) , {2, 2}));",pass,"first, let's analyze the given c/c++ code for the `even_odd_count` function. the function takes an integer `num` as input and returns a vector of two integers, representing the count of even and odd digits in the input number.

1. the function first converts the absolute value of the input integer to a string using `to_string(abs(num))`. this is done to iterate through each digit of the number easily.
2. two integer variables `n1` and `n2` are initialized to 0. these variables will store the count of odd and even digits, respectively.
3. the function iterates through each character in the string `w` using a for loop.
4. for each character, it checks if the character is odd by using the condition `w[i] % 2 == 1`. if the condition is true, it increments the `n1` (odd count) by 1, otherwise, it increments the `n2` (even count) by 1.
5. finally, the function returns a vector containing `n2` (even count) and `n1` (odd count).

now let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(even_odd_count(3452) , {2, 2}));
```

the assertion is checking if the result of `even_odd_count(3452)` is the same as the vector `{2, 2}`.

let's see if the function produces the expected output for the given input:

1. the input number is 3452.
2. the absolute value of the input number is 3452.
3. the string representation of the input number is ""3452"".
4. iterating through the string:
   - '3' is an odd digit, so `n1` (odd count) becomes 1.
   - '4' is an even digit, so `n2` (even count) becomes 1.
   - '5' is an odd digit, so `n1` (odd count) becomes 2.
   - '2' is an even digit, so `n2` (even count) becomes 2.
5. the function returns the vector `{2, 2}`.

the output of the function matches the expected output in the assertion statement. therefore, the assertion passes.

6. finally, it returns a vector containing the counts of even and odd digits, `{n2, n1}`.

now, let's evaluate the assertion statement:

```

the assertion is checking if the result of `even_odd_count(346211)` is the same as the vector `{3, 3}`.

let's compute the result of `even_odd_count(346211)`:

1. the input number is 346211.
2. the absolute value of the input number is 346211.
3. the string representation of the input number is ""346211"".
4. iterating through the characters of the string:
   - '3' is an odd digit, so `n1` becomes 1.
   - '4' is an even digit, so `n2` becomes 1.
   - '6' is an even digit, so `n2` becomes 2.
   - '2' is an even digit, so `n2` becomes 3.
   - '1' is an odd digit, so `n1` becomes 2.
   - '1' is an odd digit, so `n1` becomes 3.
5. the function returns the vector `{3, 3}`.

comparing the result of `even_odd_count(346211)` with the expected value `{3, 3}`, we can see that they are the same.

the assertion statement checks if the result of `even_odd_count(-345821)` is the same as `{3, 3}`.

### execution

1. `num` = -345821

the function works as follows:
1. it converts the absolute value of the input number to a string `w`.
2. it initializes two variables `n1` and `n2` to store the count of odd and even digits respectively.
3. it iterates through the characters of the string `w` and checks if each character (digit) is odd or even. if the digit is odd, it increments `n1`, otherwise, it increments `n2`.
4. finally, it returns a vector containing `n2` (even count) and `n1` (odd count).

now let's analyze the assertion statement:
```
assert (issame(even_odd_count(-2) , {1, 0}));
```

the assertion is checking if the result of `even_odd_count(-2)` is the same as the vector `{1, 0}`. the input number is -2, and the absolute value of -2 is 2. the digit 2 is even, so the expected output should be `{1, 0}`, which means 1 even digit and 0 odd digits.

since the function `even_odd_count` correctly calculates the count of even and odd digits, the assertion should pass.

the assertion is checking if the result of `even_odd_count(-45347)` is the same as the vector `{2, 3}`. to determine if the assertion passes or fails, we need to compute the result of `even_odd_count(-45347)`:

1. the absolute value of -45347 is 45347.
2. converting 45347 to a string gives ""45347"".
3. iterating through the characters of ""45347"":
   - '4' is even, so increment `n2` (even count) to 1.
   - '5' is odd, so increment `n1` (odd count) to 1.
   - '3' is odd, so increment `n1` (odd count) to 2.
   - '4' is even, so increment `n2` (even count) to 2.
   - '7' is odd, so increment `n1` (odd count) to 3.

this assertion checks if the output of `even_odd_count(0)` is the same as the vector `{1, 0}`. let's see what happens when we call `even_odd_count(0)`:

2. the absolute value of `num` is 0, so `w` becomes ""0"".
3. `n1` and `n2` are initialized to 0.
4. the loop iterates through the single character in `w`, which is '0'.
