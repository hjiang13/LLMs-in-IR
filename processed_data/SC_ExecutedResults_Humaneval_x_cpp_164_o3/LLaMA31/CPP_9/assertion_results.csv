"assert (issame(rolling_max({}),{}));",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's first understand the `rolling_max` function and then check if the assertion passes or fails.

the `rolling_max` function takes a vector of integers as input and generates a new vector of the same size. for each position in the output vector, it stores the maximum value encountered so far in the input vector.

now let's analyze the assertion:

```
assert (issame(rolling_max({}),{}));
```

this assertion checks if the result of calling `rolling_max` with an empty vector is equal to an empty vector.

let's go through the `rolling_max` function with an empty vector as input:

1. `vector<int> out;` - an empty output vector is created.
2. `int max=0;` - the variable `max` is initialized to 0.
3. the for loop doesn't execute because the input vector `numbers` is empty.
4. the function returns the empty output vector `out`.

so, the output of `rolling_max({})` is an empty vector `{}`.

now, let's compare the output with the expected result in the assertion:

```
issame(rolling_max({}), {})
```

since `rolling_max({})` returns an empty vector and the expected result is also an empty vector, the `issame` function should return true.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(rolling_max({1, 2, 3, 4}) , {1, 2, 3, 4}));",pass,"### analysis

first, let's go through the given c/c++ code for the `rolling_max` function. the function takes a vector of integers as input and generates a vector of rolling maximum elements found until the given moment in the sequence.

the function initializes an empty vector `out` and a variable `max` to store the maximum value encountered so far. it then iterates through the input vector `numbers`. for each element, it checks if the current element is greater than the current `max`. if it is, it updates the value of `max` to the current element. then, it appends the current value of `max` to the output vector `out`. finally, the function returns the output vector `out`.

now, let's analyze the given assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(rolling_max({1, 2, 3, 4}) , {1, 2, 3, 4}));
```

the assertion checks if the output of `rolling_max({1, 2, 3, 4})` is the same as `{1, 2, 3, 4}`. let's see if this is true.

when we call `rolling_max({1, 2, 3, 4})`, the function will iterate through the input vector and generate the following output vector:

1. first element: `max` is 0, and the current element is 1, which is greater than `max`. so, `max` becomes 1, and we append 1 to the output vector.
2. second element: `max` is 1, and the current element is 2, which is greater than `max`. so, `max` becomes 2, and we append 2 to the output vector.
3. third element: `max` is 2, and the current element is 3, which is greater than `max`. so, `max` becomes 3, and we append 3 to the output vector.
4. fourth element: `max` is 3, and the current element is 4, which is greater than `max`. so, `max` becomes 4, and we append 4 to the output vector.

the final output vector is `{1, 2, 3, 4}`, which is the same as the expected output in the assertion statement.

first, let's go through the given c/c++ code to understand the logic of the `rolling_max` function:

1. the function takes a vector of integers called `numbers` as input.
2. it initializes an empty vector called `out` and an integer variable `max` set to 0.
3. it iterates through the `numbers` vector using a for loop.
4. for each element in `numbers`, it checks if the element is greater than the current `max`. if it is, it updates `max` to the value of that element.
5. it then adds the current `max` value to the `out` vector.
6. after iterating through all elements in `numbers`, it returns the `out` vector.

now let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(rolling_max({4, 3, 2, 1}),{4, 4, 4, 4}));
```

this assertion checks if the output of `rolling_max({4, 3, 2, 1})` is the same as the vector `{4, 4, 4, 4}`. let's see if this is true:

1. when `i = 0`, `numbers[0] = 4` which is greater than `max = 0`. so, `max` is updated to 4 and added to the `out` vector. now, `out = {4}`.
2. when `i = 1`, `numbers[1] = 3` which is not greater than `max = 4`. so, `max` remains 4 and is added to the `out` vector. now, `out = {4, 4}`.
3. when `i = 2`, `numbers[2] = 2` which is not greater than `max = 4`. so, `max` remains 4 and is added to the `out` vector. now, `out = {4, 4, 4}`.
4. when `i = 3`, `numbers[3] = 1` which is not greater than `max = 4`. so, `max` remains 4 and is added to the `out` vector. now, `out = {4, 4, 4, 4}`.

the output of `rolling_max({4, 3, 2, 1})` is indeed `{4, 4, 4, 4}`.

"assert (issame(rolling_max({3, 2, 3, 100, 3}) ,{3, 3, 3, 100, 100}));",pass,"first, let's analyze the given c/c++ code for the `rolling_max` function. the function takes a vector of integers as input and generates a new vector with the rolling maximum element found until the given moment in the sequence.

now, let's go through the assertion statement and see if it passes or fails.

assertion statement:
```
assert (issame(rolling_max({3, 2, 3, 100, 3}) ,{3, 3, 3, 100, 100}));
```

we need to check if the output of `rolling_max({3, 2, 3, 100, 3})` is the same as `{3, 3, 3, 100, 100}`.

let's go through the `rolling_max` function step by step with the input `{3, 2, 3, 100, 3}`:

1. initialize `max` to 0 and an empty vector `out`.
2. iterate through the input vector:
   - at index 0, `numbers[0]` is 3, which is greater than `max` (0). so, `max` becomes 3, and we push 3 to `out`. now, `out` is `{3}`.
   - at index 1, `numbers[1]` is 2, which is not greater than `max` (3). so, `max` remains 3, and we push 3 to `out`. now, `out` is `{3, 3}`.
   - at index 2, `numbers[2]` is 3, which is not greater than `max` (3). so, `max` remains 3, and we push 3 to `out`. now, `out` is `{3, 3, 3}`.
   - at index 3, `numbers[3]` is 100, which is greater than `max` (3). so, `max` becomes 100, and we push 100 to `out`. now, `out` is `{3, 3, 3, 100}`.
   - at index 4, `numbers[4]` is 3, which is not greater than `max` (100). so, `max` remains 100, and we push 100 to `out`. now, `out` is `{3, 3, 3, 100, 100}`.

the output of `rolling_max({3, 2, 3, 100, 3})` is `{3, 3, 3, 100, 100}`, which is the same as the expected output in the assertion statement.
