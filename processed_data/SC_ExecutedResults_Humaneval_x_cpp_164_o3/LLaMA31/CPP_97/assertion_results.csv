"assert (multiply(148, 412) == 16                   );",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's first understand the given c/c++ code for the `multiply` function.

the function takes two integer inputs, `a` and `b`. it calculates the absolute values of `a` and `b` using the `abs` function, then takes the modulo 10 of each result. this effectively isolates the unit digits of the input integers. finally, the function returns the product of these unit digits.

now let's evaluate the assertion statement:

```
assert (multiply(148, 412) == 16);
```

we need to check if the `multiply` function with inputs 148 and 412 returns 16.

1. calculate the absolute values of the inputs: `abs(148)` is 148, and `abs(412)` is 412.
2. calculate the modulo 10 of each result: `148 % 10` is 8, and `412 % 10` is 2.
3. multiply the unit digits: `8 * 2` is 16.

the `multiply` function with inputs 148 and 412 returns 16, which matches the expected value in the assertion statement.

"assert (multiply(19, 28) == 72       );",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's first understand the given function `multiply`.

the function `multiply` takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns the product of their unit digits. it does this by taking the absolute values of `a` and `b` (using the `abs` function), then calculating the remainder when divided by 10 (using the modulo operator `%`). this gives us the unit digits of the input integers. finally, the function multiplies these unit digits and returns the result.

now let's analyze the given assertion:

```
assert (multiply(19, 28) == 72       );
```

the assertion checks if the result of `multiply(19, 28)` is equal to 72.

1. calculate the unit digits of the input integers:
   - for 19: `abs(19) % 10 = 9`
   - for 28: `abs(28) % 10 = 8`

2. multiply the unit digits:
   - `9 * 8 = 72`

3. compare the result with the expected value in the assertion:
   - `72 == 72`

since the result of `multiply(19, 28)` is equal to 72, the assertion passes.

"assert (multiply(2020, 1851) == 0);",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's first understand the given function `multiply` and then evaluate the assertion statement.

the `multiply` function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns the product of their unit digits. it does this by taking the absolute value of both integers, then applying the modulo operator `%` with 10 to get the unit digit of each number, and finally multiplying those unit digits together.

now, let's evaluate the assertion statement:

```
assert (multiply(2020, 1851) == 0);
```

here, the `multiply` function is called with the arguments `2020` and `1851`. according to the function definition, it should return the product of the unit digits of these two numbers.

unit digit of 2020 is 0 (since 2020 % 10 = 0).
unit digit of 1851 is 1 (since 1851 % 10 = 1).

now, let's multiply the unit digits: 0 * 1 = 0.

the assertion statement checks if the result of `multiply(2020, 1851)` is equal to 0. since the result is indeed 0, the assertion passes.

"assert (multiply(14,-15) == 20   );",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the given function and the assertion statement step by step.

1. the function `multiply` takes two integer inputs, `a` and `b`.
2. it calculates the absolute values of `a` and `b` using the `abs` function.
3. it then calculates the unit digits of the absolute values of `a` and `b` by taking the modulo 10 of each.
4. finally, it returns the product of the unit digits.

now let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (multiply(14,-15) == 20   );
```

1. the function `multiply` is called with the arguments `14` and `-15`.
2. the absolute values of the arguments are `14` and `15`.
3. the unit digits of the absolute values are `4` and `5`.
4. the product of the unit digits is `4 * 5 = 20`.

the assertion statement checks if the result of `multiply(14, -15)` is equal to `20`. based on our analysis, the result is indeed `20`, so the assertion should pass.

```cpp
int multiply(int a,int b){
    return (abs(a)%10)*(abs(b)%10);

this function takes two integers `a` and `b`, calculates the absolute values of their unit digits (using `abs` and `%` operator), and returns the product of those unit digits.

now, let's evaluate the assertion statement:

```cpp
assert (multiply(76, 67) == 42);
```

we need to check if the result of `multiply(76, 67)` is equal to 42.

1. calculate the unit digit of the first number `76`: `abs(76) % 10 = 6`
2. calculate the unit digit of the second number `67`: `abs(67) % 10 = 7`
3. multiply the unit digits: `6 * 7 = 42`

the result of `multiply(76, 67)` is indeed 42, so the assertion should pass.

   - for 27, the unit digit is also 7 (27 % 10 = 7).

2. multiply the unit digits:
   - 7 * 7 = 49

the function `multiply` should return 49, which matches the expected value in the assertion statement.
