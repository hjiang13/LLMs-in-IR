"assert (issame(maximum({-3, -4, 5}, 3) , {-4, -3, 5}));",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the given code and the assertion statement step by step.

1. the `maximum` function takes a vector of integers `arr` and an integer `k` as input.
2. it sorts the input vector `arr` in ascending order using the `sort` function from the `<algorithm>` library.
3. it then creates a new vector `out` with the last `k` elements of the sorted `arr` vector.
4. finally, it returns the `out` vector.

now let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(maximum({-3, -4, 5}, 3) , {-4, -3, 5}));
```

1. the `maximum` function is called with the input vector `{-3, -4, 5}` and `k = 3`.
2. after sorting, the input vector becomes `{-4, -3, 5}`.
3. the `out` vector is created with the last 3 elements of the sorted input vector, which are `{-4, -3, 5}`.
4. the `out` vector is returned, and the `issame` function checks if the returned vector is the same as the expected output `{-4, -3, 5}`.

since the returned vector `{-4, -3, 5}` is the same as the expected output `{-4, -3, 5}`, the assertion will pass.

"assert (issame(maximum({-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1}, 1) , {2}));",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the given function `maximum` and see what it does:

1. the function takes a vector `arr` and an integer `k` as input.
2. it sorts the vector `arr` in ascending order using `sort(arr.begin(), arr.end())`.
3. it creates a new vector `out` with the last `k` elements of the sorted `arr` using `vector<int> out(arr.end()-k, arr.end())`.
4. it returns the `out` vector.

now let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(maximum({-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1}, 1) , {2}));

the assertion is checking if the result of the `maximum` function with the input vector `{-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1}` and `k = 1` is the same as the vector `{2}`.

let's go through the `maximum` function with the given input:

1. the input vector is `{-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1}` and `k = 1`.
2. after sorting the vector, it becomes `{-3, -2, -1, 1, 1, 2, 2}`.
3. the function creates a new vector `out` with the last `k` elements, which is `{2}` in this case.
4. the function returns the `out` vector, which is `{2}`.

now, let's compare the result of the `maximum` function with the expected output in the assertion:

- the result of the `maximum` function is `{2}`.
- the expected output in the assertion is `{2}`.

since both the result and the expected output are the same, the assertion passes.
