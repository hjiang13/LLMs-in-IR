"assert (do_algebra({""**"", ""*"", ""+""}, {2, 3, 4, 5}) == 37);",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the function `do_algebra` step by step with the given input values.

input:
- operato = {""**"", ""*"", ""+""}
- operand = {2, 3, 4, 5}

1. initialize two vectors, `num` and `posto`. `num` is not used in the function, so we can ignore it. `posto` is initialized with the indices of the `operand` vector, which are {0, 1, 2, 3}.

2. iterate through the `operato` vector and perform the operations according to their precedence.

3. first, process the exponentiation operation ""**"":
    - i = 0, operato[i] = ""**""
    - calculate the result of 2^3 (operand[0]^operand[1]) and store it in operand[0]. now, operand = {8, 3, 4, 5}.
    - update posto: posto[1] = posto[0], so posto = {0, 0, 2, 3}.

4. next, process the multiplication operation ""*"":
    - i = 1, operato[i] = ""*""
    - calculate the result of 8 * 4 (operand[0] * operand[2]) and store it in operand[0]. now, operand = {32, 3, 4, 5}.
    - update posto: posto[2] = posto[0], so posto = {0, 0, 0, 3}.

5. finally, process the addition operation ""+"":
    - i = 2, operato[i] = ""+""
    - calculate the result of 32 + 5 (operand[0] + operand[3]) and store it in operand[0]. now, operand = {37, 3, 4, 5}.
    - update posto: posto[3] = posto[0], so posto = {0, 0, 0, 0}.

6. the function returns operand[0], which is 37.

now let's check the assertion:

```
assert (do_algebra({""**"", ""*"", ""+""}, {2, 3, 4, 5}) == 37);
```

since the function returns 37, the assertion is true.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (do_algebra({""+"", ""*"", ""-""}, {2, 3, 4, 5}) == 9);",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the function `do_algebra` step by step with the given input.

1. initialize two vectors, `num` and `posto`. `num` is not used in the function, so we can ignore it. `posto` is initialized with the indices of the `operand` vector, i.e., {0, 1, 2, 3}.

2. iterate through the `operato` vector and perform the operations according to their precedence (exponentiation, multiplication/division, addition/subtraction).

3. for the given input, there are no exponentiation operations, so we move to the next loop for multiplication/division.

4. in the second loop, we find a multiplication operation at index 1. we update the `operand` and `posto` vectors accordingly:
    - `operand[1] = operand[1] * operand[2]` (3 * 4 = 12)
    - `posto[2] = posto[1]` (now `posto` is {0, 1, 1, 3})

5. in the third loop, we perform the addition and subtraction operations. first, we find an addition operation at index 0:
    - `operand[0] = operand[0] + operand[1]` (2 + 12 = 14)
    - `posto[1] = posto[0]` (now `posto` is {0, 0, 1, 3})

6. next, we find a subtraction operation at index 2:
    - `operand[0] = operand[0] - operand[3]` (14 - 5 = 9)
    - `posto[3] = posto[0]` (now `posto` is {0, 0, 1, 0})

7. finally, the function returns `operand[0]`, which is 9.

the assertion statement is:

```
assert (do_algebra({""+"", ""*"", ""-""}, {2, 3, 4, 5}) == 9);
```

since the function returns 9 for the given input, the assertion passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (do_algebra({""//"", ""*""}, {7, 3, 4}) == 8);",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the function `do_algebra` step by step with the given input.

input:
- operato: {""//"", ""*""}
- operand: {7, 3, 4}

1. initialize two vectors, `num` and `posto`. `num` is not used in the function, so we can ignore it. `posto` is initialized with the indices of the `operand` vector, so `posto = {0, 1, 2}`.

2. iterate through the `operato` vector and check for the ""**"" operator. there is no ""**"" operator in the input, so this loop does nothing.

3. iterate through the `operato` vector again and check for ""*"" and ""//"" operators. the first operator is ""//"", so we perform the following operations:
   - update `posto` to point to the correct indices: `posto[0] = 0` and `posto[1] = 1`.
   - perform floor division: `operand[0] = operand[0] // operand[1]` => `operand[0] = 7 // 3` => `operand[0] = 2`.
   - update `posto`: `posto[1] = posto[0]` => `posto = {0, 0, 2}`.

   the second operator is ""*"", so we perform the following operations:
   - update `posto` to point to the correct indices: `posto[0] = 0` and `posto[2] = 2`.
   - perform multiplication: `operand[0] = operand[0] * operand[2]` => `operand[0] = 2 * 4` => `operand[0] = 8`.
   - update `posto`: `posto[2] = posto[0]` => `posto = {0, 0, 0}`.

4. iterate through the `operato` vector again and check for ""+"" and ""-"" operators. there are no ""+"" or ""-"" operators in the input, so this loop does nothing.

5. return `operand[0]`, which is 8.

now, let's check the assertion:

```
assert (do_algebra({""//"", ""*""}, {7, 3, 4}) == 8);
```

the function `do_algebra` returns 8, which is equal to the expected value in the assertion. therefore, the assertion passes.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
