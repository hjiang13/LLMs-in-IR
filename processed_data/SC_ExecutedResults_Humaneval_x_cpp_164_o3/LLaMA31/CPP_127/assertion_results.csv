"assert (intersection({1, 2}, {2, 3}) == ""NO"");",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the `intersection` function step by step with the given input intervals `{1, 2}` and `{2, 3}`.

1. calculate `inter1` as the maximum of the start points of the intervals: `max(1, 2) = 2`.
2. calculate `inter2` as the minimum of the end points of the intervals: `min(2, 3) = 2`.
3. calculate the length of the intersection `l` as `inter2 - inter1 = 2 - 2 = 0`.
4. check if the length `l` is less than 2. since `l = 0`, the condition is true, and the function returns ""no"".

now let's check the assertion statement:

```
assert (intersection({1, 2}, {2, 3}) == ""no"");
```

since the `intersection` function returns ""no"" for the input intervals `{1, 2}` and `{2, 3}`, the assertion statement is true.

2. calculate `inter2` as the minimum of the end points of the two intervals: `min(1, 4) = 1`.
3. calculate the length of the intersection `l = inter2 - inter1 = 1 - 0 = 1`.
4. check if the length is less than 2, which it is, so the function returns ""no"".

now let's check the assertion statement:

the function `intersection({-1, 1}, {0, 4})` returns ""no"", so the assertion statement is:

since both sides of the equality are the same, the assertion passes.

"assert (intersection({-3, -1}, {-5, 5}) == ""YES"");",fail,"to analyze the given assertion, let's first understand the code and then evaluate the assertion statement.

1. the code defines a function `intersection` that takes two intervals as input, represented by two vectors of integers, `interval1` and `interval2`.
2. it calculates the intersection of the two intervals by finding the maximum of the start points (`inter1`) and the minimum of the end points (`inter2`).
3. the length of the intersection is calculated as `l = inter2 - inter1`.
4. if the length is less than 2, the function returns ""no"" since the length cannot be a prime number.
5. otherwise, it checks if the length is a prime number by iterating from 2 to the square root of the length. if the length is divisible by any number in this range, the function returns ""no"".
6. if the loop completes without finding any divisors, the function returns ""yes"", indicating that the length of the intersection is a prime number.

now let's evaluate the assertion statement:

```
assert (intersection({-3, -1}, {-5, 5}) == ""yes"");
```

1. the intervals are `{-3, -1}` and `{-5, 5}`.
2. the intersection is calculated as `{-1, -1}` because the maximum start point is -1 and the minimum end point is -1.
3. the length of the intersection is 0, which is less than 2.
4. since the length is less than 2, the function returns ""no"".

the assertion statement expects the result to be ""yes"", but the function returns ""no"". therefore, the assertion fails.

1. the function takes two intervals as input, represented by two vectors of integers, `interval1` and `interval2`.
2. it calculates the intersection interval by finding the maximum of the start points (`inter1`) and the minimum of the end points (`inter2`).
3. it calculates the length of the intersection interval (`l`) by subtracting `inter1` from `inter2`.

now let's analyze the given assertion statement:

```
assert (intersection({-2, 2}, {-4, 0}) == ""yes"");
```

we need to determine if the intersection of the intervals `{-2, 2}` and `{-4, 0}` has a length that is a prime number.

1. the intersection of the intervals `{-2, 2}` and `{-4, 0}` is `{-2, 0}`.
2. the length of the intersection interval is `0 - (-2) = 2`.
3. the number 2 is a prime number.

since the length of the intersection is a prime number, the function should return ""yes"". the assertion statement is correct.

"assert (intersection({1, 2}, {3, 5}) == ""NO"");",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's first understand the given code and the assertion statement.

the given code is a function named `intersection` that takes two intervals as input (in the form of vectors) and returns ""yes"" if the length of the intersection of these two intervals is a prime number, otherwise, it returns ""no"". if the two intervals don't intersect, it also returns ""no"".

the assertion statement is:

now let's analyze the code step by step:

1. the intervals given in the assertion are {1, 2} and {3, 5}.
2. the intersection of these two intervals is calculated by finding the maximum of the start points (1 and 3) and the minimum of the end points (2 and 5).
3. so, `inter1` will be max(1, 3) which is 3, and `inter2` will be min(2, 5) which is 2.
4. the length of the intersection `l` is calculated as `inter2 - inter1` which is 2 - 3, resulting in -1.
5. since the length of the intersection is less than 2, the function will return ""no"".

the assertion statement expects the function to return ""no"" for the given intervals {1, 2} and {3, 5}. since the function does return ""no"" for these intervals, the assertion passes.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (intersection({1, 2}, {1, 2}) == ""NO"");",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's first understand the code and then evaluate the assertion statement.

### understanding the code

the function `intersection` takes two intervals as input, represented by two vectors of integers. the intervals are closed, meaning that both start and end points are included in the interval. the task is to determine if the length of the intersection of these two intervals is a prime number.

the function first calculates the intersection interval by finding the maximum of the start points and the minimum of the end points. then, it calculates the length of the intersection by subtracting the start point from the end point.

if the length is less than 2, the function returns ""no"" since the length cannot be a prime number. otherwise, it checks if the length is a prime number by iterating from 2 to the square root of the length and checking if any number divides the length evenly. if any such number is found, the function returns ""no"". if no divisors are found, the function returns ""yes"".

### evaluating the assertion

the assertion statement is:

```
assert (intersection({1, 2}, {1, 2}) == ""no"");
```

we need to check if the result of the `intersection` function with the input intervals `{1, 2}` and `{1, 2}` is equal to ""no"".

1. calculate the intersection interval:
   - start point: max(1, 1) = 1
   - end point: min(2, 2) = 2
   - intersection interval: (1, 2)

2. calculate the length of the intersection:
   - length: 2 - 1 = 1

3. check if the length is less than 2:
   - since the length is 1, which is less than 2, the function will return ""no"".

### final result

- **assertion result**: **pass**

the assertion passes because the `intersection` function returns ""no"" for the input intervals `{1, 2}` and `{1, 2}`."
"assert (intersection({-2, -2}, {-3, -2}) == ""NO"");",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's first understand the given code and the assertion statement.

the `intersection` function takes two intervals as input and returns ""yes"" if the length of their intersection is a prime number, otherwise, it returns ""no"". if the two intervals don't intersect, it also returns ""no"".

the given assertion statement is:
```
assert (intersection({-2, -2}, {-3, -2}) == ""no"");
```

now let's analyze the code step by step:

1. the intervals are `{-2, -2}` and `{-3, -2}`.
2. `inter1` will be the maximum of the start points, which is `-2`.
3. `inter2` will be the minimum of the end points, which is `-2`.
4. the length of the intersection `l` is calculated as `inter2 - inter1`, which is `0`.
5. since `l < 2`, the function returns ""no"".

the assertion statement expects the function to return ""no"" for the given intervals, and our analysis shows that the function indeed returns ""no"". therefore, the assertion passes.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
