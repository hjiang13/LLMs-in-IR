assert (issame(get_row({,unknown,"first, let's analyze the given c/c++ code for the `get_row` function. the function takes a nested vector `lst` and an integer `x` as input. it then iterates through each row and column of the nested vector, searching for the integer `x`. when it finds `x`, it adds the coordinates `{row, column}` to the output vector `out`. the function returns the output vector `out` after searching through the entire nested vector.

now, let's analyze the assertion statement. the assertion statement is incomplete, so we cannot determine if it passes or fails. however, we can analyze the given examples in the code comments to see if the function works as expected.

1. `get_row({{1,2,3,4,5,6}, {1,2,3,4,1,6}, {1,2,3,4,5,1}}, 1) == {{0, 0}, {1, 4}, {1, 0}, {2, 5}, {2, 0}}`
2. `get_row({}, 1) == {}`
3. `get_row({{}, {1}, {1, 2, 3}}, 3) == {{2, 2}}`

let's test each example:

1. example 1:
```
get_row({
  {1,2,3,4,5,6},
  {1,2,3,4,1,6},
  {1,2,3,4,5,1}
}, 1)
```
the function should return `{{0, 0}, {1, 4}, {1, 0}, {2, 5}, {2, 0}}`. after analyzing the function, we can see that it does return the expected output.

2. example 2:
```
get_row({}, 1)
```
the function should return an empty vector `{}`. since the input vector is empty, the function will not find any instances of `x` and will return an empty vector as expected.

3. example 3:
```
get_row({{}, {1}, {1, 2, 3}}, 3)
```
the function should return `{{2, 2}}`. after analyzing the function, we can see that it does return the expected output.

### final result
- assertion result for example 1: **pass**
- assertion result for example 2: **pass**
- assertion result for example 3: **pass**

since the assertion statement in the question is incomplete, we cannot determine its pass/fail result. however, based on the given examples, the `get_row` function works as expected."
assert (issame(get_row({,unknown,"first, let's analyze the provided c/c++ code for the `get_row` function. the function takes a nested vector `lst` and an integer `x` as input. it iterates through the nested vector and finds the occurrences of `x` in the vector. for each occurrence, it stores the row and column indices in a vector of vectors `out`. the function then returns the `out` vector.

now, let's look at the assertion statement:

assert (issame(get_row({

"assert (issame(get_row({}, 1) , {}));",pass,"to analyze the given assertion, let's first understand the `get_row` function and then evaluate the assertion statement.

### understanding the `get_row` function
the `get_row` function takes a 2d vector `lst` and an integer `x` as input. it searches for the integer `x` in the nested vectors and returns a vector of vectors containing the coordinates `{row, column}` where `x` is found. the coordinates are sorted by rows in ascending order and by columns in descending order.

### analyzing the assertion statement
the assertion statement is:
```cpp
assert(issame(get_row({}, 1), {}));
```
here, the `get_row` function is called with an empty vector `{}` and an integer `1`. since the input vector is empty, there are no elements to search for, and the function should return an empty vector.

### evaluating the assertion
the expected output of `get_row({}, 1)` is an empty vector `{}`. the assertion statement compares the result of `get_row({}, 1)` with an empty vector `{}` using the `issame` function. since both vectors are empty, they are considered the same, and the assertion should pass.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(get_row({{1}}, 2) , {}));",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's first understand the `get_row` function and then evaluate the assertion statement.

the `get_row` function takes a 2d vector `lst` and an integer `x` as input. it iterates through the rows and columns of `lst` and searches for the integer `x`. if it finds `x`, it adds the corresponding row and column indices as a vector `{i, j}` to the output vector `out`. the function returns the output vector `out` containing the coordinates of `x` in `lst`.

now let's evaluate the assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(get_row({{1}}, 2) , {}));
```

the assertion statement is checking if the result of `get_row({{1}}, 2)` is the same as an empty vector `{}`. 

let's see what `get_row({{1}}, 2)` returns:

1. the input 2d vector `lst` has only one row: `{1}`.
2. the function iterates through the row and checks if the element is equal to `x` (2 in this case).
3. since there is no element equal to 2 in the input vector, the output vector `out` remains empty.
4. the function returns an empty vector: `{}`.

now, let's compare the result of `get_row({{1}}, 2)` with the expected output in the assertion statement:

```
{} == {}
```

both sides are equal, so the assertion passes.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(get_row({{}, {1}, {1, 2, 3}}, 3) , {{2, 2}}));",pass,"to analyze the given assertion, let's first understand the `get_row` function and then evaluate the assertion statement.

### understanding the `get_row` function
the `get_row` function takes a 2d vector `lst` and an integer `x` as input. it searches for the integer `x` in the nested vectors and returns a vector of vectors containing the coordinates `{row, column}` where `x` is found. the output vector is sorted by rows in ascending order, and within each row, the columns are sorted in descending order.

### evaluating the assertion statement
the assertion statement is:
```cpp
assert(issame(get_row({{}, {1}, {1, 2, 3}}, 3), {{2, 2}}));
```

here, the `get_row` function is called with the input `lst = {{}, {1}, {1, 2, 3}}` and `x = 3`. let's see what the function would return for this input:

1. the function starts iterating through the rows of `lst`.
2. the first row is empty, so no match is found.
3. in the second row, there is only one element (1), which doesn't match `x` (3).
4. in the third row, there are three elements (1, 2, 3). the function iterates through this row in reverse order (3, 2, 1) and finds a match for `x` (3) at the first iteration.
5. the function adds the coordinate `{2, 2}` to the output vector `out`.
6. the function returns the output vector `out`, which is `{{2, 2}}`.

now, let's compare the returned value with the expected value in the assertion statement:

```cpp
issame({{2, 2}}, {{2, 2}})
```

since both values are the same, the `issame` function should return `true`, and the assertion should pass.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
