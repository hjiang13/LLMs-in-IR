"assert (issame(unique_digits({15, 33, 1422, 1}) , {1, 15, 33}));",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's first understand the given function `unique_digits` and then evaluate the assertion statement.

1. the function `unique_digits` takes a vector of positive integers `x` as input.
2. it initializes an empty vector `out` to store the output.
3. it iterates through each element in the input vector `x`.
4. for each element, it checks if the number has any even digit by dividing the number by 10 iteratively and checking the remainder when divided by 2.
5. if the number doesn't have any even digit, it is added to the output vector `out`.
6. after processing all elements, the function sorts the output vector in increasing order and returns it.

now let's evaluate the assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(unique_digits({15, 33, 1422, 1}) , {1, 15, 33}));
```

1. the function `unique_digits` is called with the input vector `{15, 33, 1422, 1}`.
2. the function processes each element and filters out the numbers with even digits (1422 in this case).
3. the resulting vector is `{15, 33, 1}`.
4. the function sorts the vector, resulting in `{1, 15, 33}`.
5. the assertion statement compares the output of the function with the expected output `{1, 15, 33}`.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**

the assertion passes because the output of the function `unique_digits` for the given input matches the expected output."
"assert (issame(unique_digits({152, 323, 1422, 10}) , {}));",fail,"to analyze the assertion, let's first understand the given code and the assertion statement.

the given code defines a function `unique_digits` that takes a vector of positive integers and returns a sorted vector of all elements that don't have any even digit. the function iterates through the input vector, checks each element for even digits, and adds the element to the output vector if it doesn't contain any even digit. finally, the function sorts the output vector and returns it.

the assertion statement checks if the output of `unique_digits({152, 323, 1422, 10})` is an empty vector (`{}`). now, let's analyze the input vector:

1. 152 - contains an even digit (2), so it won't be added to the output vector.
2. 323 - contains only odd digits, so it will be added to the output vector.
3. 1422 - contains even digits (2 and 4), so it won't be added to the output vector.
4. 10 - contains an even digit (0), so it won't be added to the output vector.

after processing all the elements, the output vector will only contain 323. however, the assertion statement expects an empty vector. therefore, the assertion will fail.

"assert (issame(unique_digits({12345, 2033, 111, 151}) , {111, 151}));",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's first understand the given code and the assertion statement.

the given code defines a function `unique_digits` that takes a vector of positive integers as input and returns a sorted vector of all elements that don't have any even digit. the function iterates through the input vector, checks if each number has any even digit, and if not, adds it to the output vector. finally, it sorts the output vector in increasing order and returns it.

the assertion statement checks if the result of `unique_digits({12345, 2033, 111, 151})` is equal to `{111, 151}`.

now, let's analyze the given input and the expected output:

input: `{12345, 2033, 111, 151}`
expected output: `{111, 151}`

1. for the first element `12345`, it has an even digit `2` and `4`, so it should not be included in the output.
2. for the second element `2033`, it has an even digit `0` and `2`, so it should not be included in the output.
3. for the third element `111`, it has no even digit, so it should be included in the output.
4. for the fourth element `151`, it has no even digit, so it should be included in the output.

so, the output should be `{111, 151}`, which matches the expected output in the assertion statement.

"assert (issame(unique_digits({135, 103, 31}) , {31, 135}));",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the given function `unique_digits` step by step with the input vector `{135, 103, 31}`.

1. the function initializes an empty vector `out` to store the output.
2. it iterates through the input vector `x`, which contains the elements `{135, 103, 31}`.
3. for each element, it checks if the number has any even digit.
   - for the first element `135`, it has no even digits, so it is added to the `out` vector.
   - for the second element `103`, it has an even digit `0`, so it is not added to the `out` vector.
   - for the third element `31`, it has no even digits, so it is added to the `out` vector.
4. after iterating through all elements, the `out` vector contains `{135, 31}`.
5. the function sorts the `out` vector in increasing order, resulting in `{31, 135}`.
6. the function returns the sorted `out` vector.

now, let's compare the returned vector with the expected output in the assertion:

```
assert (issame(unique_digits({135, 103, 31}) , {31, 135}));
```

the returned vector `{31, 135}` is the same as the expected output `{31, 135}`.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
