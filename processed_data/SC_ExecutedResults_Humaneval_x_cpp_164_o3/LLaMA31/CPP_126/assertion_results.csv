assert (is_sorted({5}) == true);,pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the `is_sorted` function step by step with the given input.

input: `is_sorted({5})`

1. the function takes a vector of integers, `lst`, which in this case is `{5}`.
2. the for loop starts with `i = 1` and goes up to `lst.size()`, which is 1 in this case. so, the loop will not execute, as the condition `i < lst.size()` is not satisfied.
3. the function returns `true` as the loop did not find any issues with the sorting order or duplicates.

now, let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (is_sorted({5}) == true);
```

the assertion is checking if the result of `is_sorted({5})` is equal to `true`. since the function returns `true` for the given input, the assertion will pass.

### final result

1. the function `is_sorted` takes a vector of integers `lst` as input.
2. it iterates through the vector starting from index 1 to the end.
3. for each element, it checks if the current element is less than the previous element. if it is, the function returns `false` because the vector is not sorted in ascending order.
4. if the current index is greater than or equal to 2, it checks if the current element is equal to both the previous element and the element before the previous one. if it is, the function returns `false` because there are more than 1 duplicate of the same number.
5. if the loop completes without returning `false`, the function returns `true`, indicating that the vector is sorted in ascending order and has no more than 1 duplicate of any number.

now let's analyze the given assertion:

```
assert (is_sorted({1, 2, 3, 4, 5}) == true);
```

the assertion is checking if the function `is_sorted` returns `true` when given the input vector `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`.

let's go through the function with this input:

1. the input vector is `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`.
2. the loop starts at index 1 and goes through the vector.
3. for each element, the current element is greater than or equal to the previous element, so the first condition in the loop never returns `false`.
4. there are no duplicates in the input vector, so the second condition in the loop never returns `false`.
5. the loop completes without returning `false`, so the function returns `true`.

since the function returns `true` for the input vector `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`, the assertion passes.

1. the function starts a loop from index 1 to the size of the vector.
2. for each iteration, it checks if the current element is less than the previous element. if it is, the function returns `false`. in this case, the input vector is in ascending order, so this condition will never be met.

the `is_sorted` function returns `true` for the input `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}`. the assertion statement checks if the result is equal to `true`, which it is. therefore, the assertion passes.

3. in the second iteration, `i = 2`, so it compares `lst[2]` and `lst[1]`, which are 2 and 3 respectively. since 2 is less than 3, the first condition `if (lst[i]<lst[i-1])` is true, and the function returns `false`.

since the function returns `false`, the assertion statement `assert (is_sorted({1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}) == false);` is true, meaning the assertion passes.

assert (is_sorted({}) == true);,pass,"the given assertion is checking whether an empty vector is considered sorted or not. let's analyze the `is_sorted` function to determine the result of the assertion.

### analysis of `is_sorted` function

1. the function takes a vector of integers as input.
2. it iterates through the vector starting from the second element (index 1).
3. for each element, it checks if the current element is smaller than the previous element. if it is, the function returns `false` because the vector is not sorted in ascending order.
4. it also checks if there are more than 1 duplicate of the same number in the vector. if there are, the function returns `false`.
5. if the loop completes without returning `false`, the function returns `true`, indicating that the vector is sorted in ascending order and has no more than 1 duplicate of any number.

### assertion statement analysis

the assertion statement is:
```
assert (is_sorted({}) == true);
```

this assertion is checking whether an empty vector is considered sorted or not. since there are no elements in the vector, there are no elements that violate the conditions of being sorted in ascending order or having more than 1 duplicate. therefore, the function should return `true` for an empty vector.

### final result

- **assertion result**: **pass**

the assertion passes because the `is_sorted` function correctly returns `true` for an empty vector."
assert (is_sorted({1}) == true);,pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the `is_sorted` function step by step with the input `{1}`.

1. the function takes a vector of integers `lst` as input.
2. the for loop starts with `i = 1` and goes up to `lst.size() - 1`. in this case, the size of the input vector is 1, so the loop will not execute.
3. since the loop doesn't execute, neither of the conditions inside the loop is checked.
4. the function returns `true`.

now let's check the assertion statement:

```
assert (is_sorted({1}) == true);
```

the assertion checks if the result of `is_sorted({1})` is equal to `true`. from our analysis, we know that the function returns `true` for the input `{1}`. therefore, the assertion statement is correct.

### final result

"assert (is_sorted({3, 2, 1}) == false);",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the `is_sorted` function step by step with the input `{3, 2, 1}`.

1. in the first iteration of the loop, `i = 1`:
   - `lst[i]` is 2, and `lst[i-1]` is 3. since 2 < 3, the condition `lst[i] < lst[i-1]` is true, so the function returns `false`.

since the function returns `false` for the input `{3, 2, 1}`, the assertion `assert (is_sorted({3, 2, 1}) == false)` is correct.

1. the function starts iterating through the input vector from index 1 (the second element).
2. it compares the current element with the previous one. if the current element is smaller than the previous one, the function returns `false`. in this case, the input vector is already sorted in ascending order, so this condition will not be met.
3. the function also checks if there are more than 1 duplicate of the same number. it does this by comparing the current element with the previous two elements. if all three elements are equal, the function returns `false`.

now let's analyze the input vector `{1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4}`:
- at index 1, the value is 2, which is greater than or equal to the previous value (1). there are no three consecutive equal elements yet.
- at index 2, the value is 2, which is equal to the previous value (2). there are no three consecutive equal elements yet.
- at index 3, the value is 2, which is equal to the previous value (2) and the value before that (2). this meets the condition for having more than 1 duplicate of the same number, so the function returns `false`.

the assertion `assert (is_sorted({1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4}) == false);` expects the function to return `false` for the given input. since the function does return `false`, the assertion passes.

3. in the second iteration, `i = 2`, and the conditions are still false. the loop continues.
4. in the third iteration, `i = 3`, and the conditions are still false. the loop continues.
5. in the fourth iteration, `i = 4`, the first condition `lst[i] < lst[i-1]` is false, but the second condition `i >= 2 and lst[i] == lst[i-1] and lst[i] == lst[i-2]` is true because `lst[4] == lst[3] == lst[2] == 3`. so, the function returns `false`.
