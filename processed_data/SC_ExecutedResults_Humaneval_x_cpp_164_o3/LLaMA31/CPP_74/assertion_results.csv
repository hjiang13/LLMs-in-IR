"assert (issame(total_match({}, {}) , {}));",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's first understand the `total_match` function and then evaluate the assertion statement.

1. the `total_match` function takes two vectors of strings (`lst1` and `lst2`) as input.
2. it initializes two integer variables `num1` and `num2` to store the total number of characters in `lst1` and `lst2`, respectively.
3. it iterates through `lst1` and `lst2` and calculates the total number of characters in each vector by adding the length of each string to `num1` and `num2`.
4. if `num1` is greater than `num2`, the function returns `lst2`. otherwise, it returns `lst1`.

now let's evaluate the assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(total_match({}, {}) , {}));
```

the `total_match` function is called with two empty vectors `{}`. since both vectors are empty, their total number of characters is 0. therefore, the function will return the first vector, which is also an empty vector `{}`.

the `issame` function checks if the returned vector is the same as the expected vector, which is also an empty vector `{}`. since both vectors are empty, they are considered the same.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(total_match({""hi"", ""admin""}, {""hi"", ""hi""}) , {""hi"", ""hi""}));",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the `total_match` function with the given input values:

1. input vectors are: `lst1 = {""hi"", ""admin""}` and `lst2 = {""hi"", ""hi""}`
2. initialize `num1` and `num2` to 0.
3. calculate the total number of characters in `lst1`:
   - ""hi"" has 2 characters
   - ""admin"" has 5 characters
   - so, `num1 = 2 + 5 = 7`
4. calculate the total number of characters in `lst2`:
   - ""hi"" has 2 characters
   - ""hi"" has 2 characters
   - so, `num2 = 2 + 2 = 4`
5. compare `num1` and `num2`: since `num1 > num2`, the function returns `lst2`.

now let's evaluate the assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(total_match({""hi"", ""admin""}, {""hi"", ""hi""}), {""hi"", ""hi""}));

the `total_match` function returns `{""hi"", ""hi""}` for the given input, which is the expected result in the assertion. therefore, the assertion passes.

1. initialize num1 and num2 to 0.
2. calculate the total number of characters in lst1:
   - ""hi"" has 2 characters

3. calculate the total number of characters in lst2:

   - ""project"" has 7 characters
   - num2 = 2 + 2 + 5 + 7 = 16
4. compare num1 and num2:
   - num1 (7) < num2 (16), so the function returns lst1

the function returns lst1, which is {""hi"", ""admin""}.

now let's analyze the assertion statement:

the assertion checks if the result of `total_match({""hi"", ""admin""}, {""hi"", ""hi"", ""admin"", ""project""})` is the same as `{""hi"", ""admin""}`. since the function returns `{""hi"", ""admin""}`, the assertion is true.

1. initialize `num1` and `num2` to 0.
2. iterate through `lst1` and add the length of each string to `num1`.

4. compare `num1` and `num2`.
   - `num1 > num2` => `1 > 5` is false
5. return `lst1` since the condition is false.

the function returns `{""4""}`.

now let's analyze the assertion statement:

the `issame` function checks if the result of `total_match({""4""}, {""1"", ""2"", ""3"", ""4"", ""5""})` is the same as `{""4""}`. since the function returns `{""4""}`, the assertion should pass.

"assert (issame(total_match({""hi"", ""admin""}, {""hI"", ""hi"", ""hii""}) , {""hi"", ""admin""}));",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's first understand the given c/c++ code and the function `total_match`.

the `total_match` function takes two vectors of strings as input and returns the vector with the smaller total number of characters in all its strings. if both vectors have the same total number of characters, it returns the first vector.

now let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(total_match({""hi"", ""admin""}, {""hi"", ""hi"", ""hii""}) , {""hi"", ""admin""}));
```

here, we are calling the `total_match` function with two vectors of strings: `{""hi"", ""admin""}` and `{""hi"", ""hi"", ""hii""}`. we will calculate the total number of characters in each vector and compare them.

1. for the first vector `{""hi"", ""admin""}`:
   - ""hi"" has 2 characters
   - ""admin"" has 5 characters
   - total number of characters: 2 + 5 = 7

2. for the second vector `{""hi"", ""hi"", ""hii""}`:
   - ""hi"" has 2 characters
   - ""hi"" has 2 characters
   - ""hii"" has 3 characters
   - total number of characters: 2 + 2 + 3 = 7

since both vectors have the same total number of characters (7), the `total_match` function will return the first vector `{""hi"", ""admin""}`.

the assertion statement is comparing the result of `total_match` with the expected output `{""hi"", ""admin""}` using the `issame` function. since the result and the expected output are the same, the assertion will pass.

"assert (issame(total_match({}, {""this""}) , {}));",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's first understand the given c/c++ code and the function `total_match`.

the `total_match` function takes two vectors of strings (`lst1` and `lst2`) as input and returns the vector with the smaller total number of characters in all its strings. if both vectors have the same total number of characters, the function returns the first vector (`lst1`).

now let's analyze the given assertion:

```
assert (issame(total_match({}, {""this""}) , {}));
```

in this assertion, we are calling the `total_match` function with an empty vector `{}` as the first argument and a vector with a single string `""this""` as the second argument. the expected result is an empty vector `{}`.

let's see what the `total_match` function would return in this case:

1. `num1` will be 0 since the first vector is empty.
2. `num2` will be 4 since the second vector has one string with 4 characters (""this"").
3. since `num1` (0) is less than `num2` (4), the function will return the first vector, which is an empty vector `{}`.

the result of `total_match({}, {""this""})` is an empty vector `{}`, which matches the expected result in the assertion.

1. initialize num1 and num2 to 0.
2. iterate through lst1 and add the length of each string to num1.
   - num1 = 0 + 4 (""this"".length() = 4) => num1 = 4
3. iterate through lst2 and add the length of each string to num2.
   - lst2 is empty, so num2 remains 0.
4. compare num1 and num2.
   - num1 (4) > num2 (0), so the function returns lst2, which is an empty vector {}.

now let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(total_match({""this""}, {}) , {}));
```

the assertion is checking if the result of `total_match({""this""}, {})` is the same as an empty vector `{}`. since we have already determined that the function returns an empty vector `{}` for the given input, the assertion should pass.
