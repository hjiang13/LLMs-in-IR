"assert (issame(parse_music("""") , {}));",pass,"### thinking process

1. the function `parse_music` takes a string `music_string` as input and returns a vector of integers representing the number of beats for each note in the input string.
2. the function iterates through the input string character by character, building a `current` string for each note until it encounters a space character.
3. when a space character is encountered, the function checks the `current` string and pushes the corresponding number of beats to the output vector `out` based on the given legend:
   - ""o"" corresponds to 4 beats
   - ""o|"" corresponds to 2 beats
   - "".|"" corresponds to 1 beat
4. after processing the entire input string, the function returns the output vector `out`.
5. the assertion statement checks if the result of calling `parse_music` with an empty string is an empty vector.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**

the assertion passes because when the input string is empty, the function does not push any elements to the output vector, resulting in an empty vector being returned."
"assert (issame(parse_music(""o o o o"") ,{4, 4, 4, 4}));",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the `parse_music` function step by step with the input string ""o o o o"".

1. the function initializes an empty string `current` and an empty vector `out`.
2. it checks if the input string's length is greater than 0, which is true in this case. so, it adds a space at the end of the input string, making it ""o o o o "".
3. the function iterates through each character of the input string:
   - for the first character 'o', it adds it to the `current` string, making it ""o"".
   - for the second character ' ', it checks the `current` string and finds it to be ""o"". so, it adds 4 to the `out` vector and resets the `current` string to """".
   - this process continues for the rest of the characters in the input string.
4. at the end of the loop, the `out` vector contains {4, 4, 4, 4}.
5. the function returns the `out` vector.

now, let's check the assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(parse_music(""o o o o"") ,{4, 4, 4, 4}));
```

the `parse_music` function returns {4, 4, 4, 4} for the input string ""o o o o"", which is the same as the expected output in the assertion statement.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(parse_music("".| .| .| .|"") , {1, 1, 1, 1}));",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the `parse_music` function step by step with the given input `"".| .| .| .|""`:

1. initialize an empty string `current` and an empty vector `out`.
2. the input string is not empty, so we append a space at the end: `"".| .| .| .| ""`.
3. iterate through the input string character by character:
   - for the first character '.', add it to `current`: `current = "".""`.
   - for the second character '|', add it to `current`: `current = "".|""`.
   - for the third character ' ', check `current`:
     - `current` is equal to "".|"", so we push 1 to `out`: `out = {1}`.
     - reset `current` to an empty string.
   - repeat this process for the rest of the characters in the input string.
4. after iterating through the entire input string, the `out` vector will be `{1, 1, 1, 1}`.

now let's check the assertion:

```
assert (issame(parse_music("".| .| .| .|"") , {1, 1, 1, 1}));
```

since the `parse_music` function returns `{1, 1, 1, 1}` for the input `"".| .| .| .|""` and the expected output is also `{1, 1, 1, 1}`, the assertion will pass.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(parse_music(""o| o| .| .| o o o o"") , {2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4}));",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's first understand the `parse_music` function and then apply it to the input string in the assertion.

the `parse_music` function takes a string of musical notes in a special ascii format and returns a vector of integers representing the number of beats each note lasts. the function iterates through the input string, separating it into individual notes by spaces. for each note, it checks if it's a whole note (""o""), half note (""o|""), or quarter note ("".|"") and appends the corresponding number of beats (4, 2, or 1) to the output vector.

now let's apply the function to the input string in the assertion: ""o| o| .| .| o o o o"".

1. ""o|"" - half note, lasts 2 beats
2. ""o|"" - half note, lasts 2 beats
3. "".|"" - quarter note, lasts 1 beat
4. "".|"" - quarter note, lasts 1 beat
5. ""o"" - whole note, lasts 4 beats
6. ""o"" - whole note, lasts 4 beats
7. ""o"" - whole note, lasts 4 beats
8. ""o"" - whole note, lasts 4 beats

the expected output vector is {2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4}.

now let's compare the expected output with the actual output of the `parse_music` function:

- expected: {2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4}
- actual: {2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4}

the expected and actual outputs are the same, so the assertion passes.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(parse_music(""o| .| o| .| o o| o o|"") , {2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 4, 2}));",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the `parse_music` function step by step with the given input string.

input string: `""o| .| o| .| o o| o o|""`

1. the function initializes an empty string `current` and an empty vector `out`.
2. it adds a space at the end of the input string to handle the last note.
3. it iterates through the input string character by character:
   - if the character is a space, it checks the `current` string and adds the corresponding number of beats to the `out` vector, then resets the `current` string to be empty.
   - if the character is not a space, it appends the character to the `current` string.

let's go through the input string:

- ""o|""
  - `current` = ""o|"", a space is encountered, so it adds 2 to the `out` vector, and `current` is reset to """".
- "".|""
  - `current` = "".|"", a space is encountered, so it adds 1 to the `out` vector, and `current` is reset to """".
- ""o|""
  - `current` = ""o|"", a space is encountered, so it adds 2 to the `out` vector, and `current` is reset to """".
- "".|""
  - `current` = "".|"", a space is encountered, so it adds 1 to the `out` vector, and `current` is reset to """".
- ""o""
  - `current` = ""o"", a space is encountered, so it adds 4 to the `out` vector, and `current` is reset to """".
- ""o|""
  - `current` = ""o|"", a space is encountered, so it adds 2 to the `out` vector, and `current` is reset to """".
- ""o""
  - `current` = ""o"", a space is encountered, so it adds 4 to the `out` vector, and `current` is reset to """".
- ""o|""
  - `current` = ""o|"", the end of the string is reached (with the added space), so it adds 2 to the `out` vector, and `current` is reset to """".

the resulting `out` vector is: {2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 4, 2}

now let's compare this result with the assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(parse_music(""o| .| o| .| o o| o o|"") , {2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 4, 2}));
```

the output of `parse_music(""o| .| o| .| o o| o o|"")` is `{2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 4, 2}`, which is the same as the expected result in the assertion statement.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
