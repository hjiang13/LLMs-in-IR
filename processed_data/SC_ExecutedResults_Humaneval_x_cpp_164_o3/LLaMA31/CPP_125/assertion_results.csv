"assert (issame(split_words(""Hello world!"") , {""Hello"",""world!""}));",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the `split_words` function step by step with the input ""hello world!"".

1. the function first checks if there is a whitespace character in the input string. in this case, there is a whitespace between ""hello"" and ""world!"".

2. since a whitespace is found, the function enters the first if block and appends a whitespace to the end of the input string, making it ""hello world! "".

3. the function then iterates through the characters of the input string. when it encounters a whitespace, it adds the current non-empty string (a word) to the output vector and resets the current string to an empty string.

4. in this case, the function will add ""hello"" and ""world!"" to the output vector.

5. finally, the function returns the output vector containing the words split on whitespace.

now let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(split_words(""hello world!"") , {""hello"",""world!""}));
```

the assertion checks if the result of `split_words(""hello world!"")` is the same as the vector `{""hello"", ""world!""}`. based on our analysis of the function, we can see that the function will indeed return `{""hello"", ""world!""}` for the input ""hello world!"". therefore, the assertion should pass.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(split_words(""Hello,world!"") , {""Hello"",""world!""}));",pass,"to analyze the assertion, let's go through the `split_words` function step by step with the given input ""hello,world!"".

1. the function first checks if there is a whitespace in the input string. in this case, there isn't, so it moves to the next condition.
2. the function then checks if there is a comma in the input string. in this case, there is, so it enters the corresponding block.
3. the input string is appended with a comma, making it ""hello,world!,"".
4. the function iterates through the modified input string, and when it encounters a comma, it adds the current string (if not empty) to the output vector and resets the current string.
5. in this case, the function will add ""hello"" and ""world!"" to the output vector.
6. the function returns the output vector, which is {""hello"", ""world!""}.

now let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(split_words(""hello,world!"") , {""hello"",""world!""}));
```

the assertion checks if the result of `split_words(""hello,world!"")` is the same as the expected output {""hello"", ""world!""}. based on our analysis, the function does return {""hello"", ""world!""} for the given input, so the assertion should pass.

"assert (issame(split_words(""Hello world,!"") , {""Hello"",""world,!""}));",pass,"first, let's analyze the given c/c++ code for the `split_words` function. the function takes a string `txt` as input and returns a vector of strings based on certain conditions:

1. if the input string contains whitespace, the function splits the string on whitespace and returns a vector of words.
2. if the input string doesn't contain whitespace but contains commas, the function splits the string on commas and returns a vector of words.
3. if the input string doesn't contain whitespace or commas, the function counts the number of lowercase letters with odd order in the alphabet and returns a vector with one element containing that count.

now, let's analyze the given assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(split_words(""hello world,!"") , {""hello"",""world,!""}));
```

the assertion is checking if the output of `split_words(""hello world,!"")` is the same as the vector `{""hello"", ""world,!""}`. 

let's see what the function does with the input ""hello world,!"".
1. the input string contains a whitespace, so the function will split the string on whitespace.
2. the function will return a vector of words: `{""hello"", ""world,!""}`.

the output of the function matches the expected output in the assertion statement. therefore, the assertion will pass.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(split_words(""Hello,Hello,world !"") , {""Hello,Hello,world"",""!""}));",fail,"first, let's analyze the provided code and understand the logic of the `split_words` function:

1. the function takes a string `txt` as input.
2. it initializes an empty string `current` and an empty vector `out`.
3. it checks if there is a whitespace character in the input string.
   - if there is, it adds a whitespace at the end of the input string and iterates through the characters of the string.
   - for each character, if it's a whitespace, it adds the current string to the output vector (if not empty) and resets the current string.
   - if the character is not a whitespace, it appends the character to the current string.
   - finally, it returns the output vector.
4. if there is no whitespace, it checks for a comma in the input string.
   - if there is a comma, it follows the same process as with whitespaces but using commas instead.
5. if there are no whitespaces or commas, it counts the number of lowercase letters with an odd order in the alphabet and returns a vector with a single element containing that count.

now let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(split_words(""hello,hello,world !"") , {""hello,hello,world"",""!""}));
```

the input string is ""hello,hello,world !"". since there is a comma in the input string, the function will split the string based on commas. the expected output is {""hello,hello,world"",""!""}.

however, the function will actually return {""hello"", ""hello"", ""world !""} because it splits the string on commas and does not separate the exclamation mark.

so, the assertion will fail.

"assert (issame(split_words(""abcdef"") , {""3""}));",pass,"first, let's analyze the given code and understand what it does. the `split_words` function takes a string `txt` as input and returns a vector of strings based on the following conditions:

1. if the input string contains whitespace, the function splits the string on whitespace and returns a vector of words.
2. if the input string doesn't contain whitespace but contains commas, the function splits the string on commas and returns a vector of words.
3. if the input string doesn't contain whitespace or commas, the function counts the number of lowercase letters with odd order in the alphabet and returns a vector with a single element containing that count.

now, let's analyze the given assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(split_words(""abcdef"") , {""3""}));
```

the input string ""abcdef"" doesn't contain any whitespace or commas, so the function will count the number of lowercase letters with odd order in the alphabet. the lowercase letters with odd order in the alphabet are 'b', 'd', and 'f', so the function should return a vector with a single element ""3"".

the assertion statement checks if the result of `split_words(""abcdef"")` is the same as the vector `{""3""}`. since the function should return `{""3""}`, the assertion should pass.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(split_words(""aaabb"") , {""2""}));",pass,"first, let's analyze the given code and understand the logic of the `split_words` function.

1. the function checks if there is a whitespace character in the input string `txt`. if there is, it splits the string into words based on the whitespace and returns a vector of those words.
2. if there is no whitespace character, the function checks if there is a comma (',') in the input string. if there is, it splits the string into words based on the comma and returns a vector of those words.
3. if there is no whitespace or comma, the function counts the number of lowercase letters with odd order in the alphabet (e.g., 'a', 'c', 'e', ...), and returns a vector containing a single element: the count of such letters as a string.

now let's analyze the given assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(split_words(""aaabb"") , {""2""}));
```

the input string ""aaabb"" has no whitespace or comma, so the function will count the number of lowercase letters with odd order in the alphabet. in this case, there are 3 'a's and 2 'b's. since 'a' has an even order in the alphabet (0), it will not be counted. 'b' has an odd order (1), so it will be counted. there are 2 'b's, so the function should return a vector containing a single element: the string ""2"".

the assertion statement checks if the result of `split_words(""aaabb"")` is the same as the vector `{""2""}`. since the function should return `{""2""}`, the assertion should pass.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(split_words(""aaaBb"") , {""1""}));",fail,"first, let's analyze the given code and understand what it does. the function `split_words` takes a string as input and returns a vector of strings. it has three main cases:

1. if the input string contains whitespace, it splits the string on whitespace and returns a vector of the resulting substrings.
2. if the input string contains commas (and no whitespace), it splits the string on commas and returns a vector of the resulting substrings.
3. if the input string contains neither whitespace nor commas, it counts the number of lowercase letters with odd order in the alphabet and returns a vector containing a single element: the count as a string.

now let's analyze the given assertion:

```
assert (issame(split_words(""aaabb"") , {""1""}));
```

the input string ""aaabb"" doesn't contain any whitespace or commas, so the function will count the number of lowercase letters with odd order in the alphabet. in this case, there are two lowercase letters with odd order: 'a' (order 0) and 'b' (order 1). since the assertion expects the result to be {""1""}, the assertion will fail.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **fail**"
"assert (issame(split_words("""") ,{""0""}));",pass,"first, let's analyze the given c/c++ code for the `split_words` function. the function takes a string `txt` as input and returns a vector of strings. the function has three main parts:

1. if the input string contains whitespace, it splits the string on the whitespace and returns a vector of words.
2. if the input string contains commas (and no whitespace), it splits the string on the commas and returns a vector of words.
3. if the input string contains neither whitespace nor commas, it counts the number of lowercase letters with odd order in the alphabet and returns a vector with a single element - the count.

now, let's analyze the given assertion statement:

```
assert (issame(split_words("""") ,{""0""}));
```

the assertion is checking if the result of calling `split_words` with an empty string `""""` is the same as the vector `{""0""}`.

let's see what happens when we call `split_words("""")`:

1. there is no whitespace in the input string, so the first condition is not met.
2. there are no commas in the input string, so the second condition is not met.
3. since both the above conditions are not met, the function will count the number of lowercase letters with odd order in the alphabet. since the input string is empty, there are no lowercase letters, so the count will be 0.

the function will return a vector with a single element ""0"" which matches the expected output in the assertion statement.

### final result
- **assertion result**: **pass**"
