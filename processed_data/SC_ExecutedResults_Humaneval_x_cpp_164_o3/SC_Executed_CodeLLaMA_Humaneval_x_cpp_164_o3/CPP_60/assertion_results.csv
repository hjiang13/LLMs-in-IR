assert (sum_to_n(1) == 1);,pass,"To analyze the assertion, let's break down the code and the assertion statement.

### Code Analysis

The provided C/C++ code defines a function `sum_to_n` that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to `n` using the formula `n*(n+1)/2`. This formula is a well-known mathematical formula for calculating the sum of an arithmetic series.

### Assertion Analysis

The assertion statement is `assert (sum_to_n(1) == 1);`. This statement checks if the result of calling `sum_to_n` with the argument `1` is equal to `1`.

Let's evaluate the `sum_to_n` function with the input `1`:

`sum_to_n(1) = 1*(1+1)/2 = 1*2/2 = 1`

So, the result of `sum_to_n(1)` is indeed `1`.

### Conclusion

Since the result of `sum_to_n(1)` is `1`, which is equal to the expected value in the assertion statement, the assertion will pass.

### Final Result

- **assertion result**: **pass**"

### Code Analysis

The provided C/C++ code defines a function `sum_to_n` that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to `n` using the formula `n*(n+1)/2`. This formula is a well-known mathematical formula for calculating the sum of an arithmetic series.

### Assertion Analysis

The assertion statement is `assert (sum_to_n(6) == 21);`. To evaluate this assertion, we need to calculate the result of `sum_to_n(6)` and compare it with `21`.

Using the formula `n*(n+1)/2`, we can calculate the result of `sum_to_n(6)` as follows:

`sum_to_n(6) = 6*(6+1)/2 = 6*7/2 = 21`

Therefore, the result of `sum_to_n(6)` is indeed `21`, which matches the expected value in the assertion statement.

### Final Result

Based on the analysis, the assertion passes because the result of `sum_to_n(6)` matches the expected value `21`.

assert (sum_to_n(11) == 66);,pass,"To analyze the assertion, I will follow these steps:

1. **Understand the function**: The `sum_to_n` function calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to `n` using the formula `n*(n+1)/2`. This is a well-known formula for calculating the sum of an arithmetic series.

2. **Evaluate the function for the given input**: The assertion statement calls the `sum_to_n` function with the argument `11`. Using the formula, the result is calculated as `11*(11+1)/2 = 11*12/2 = 132/2 = 66`.

3. **Compare the result with the expected value**: The assertion statement expects the result to be `66`, which matches the calculated result.

Based on the analysis, the assertion will pass because the calculated result matches the expected value.

assert (sum_to_n(30) == 465);,pass,"### Analysis of the Provided C/C++ Code

The given C/C++ code defines a function `sum_to_n` that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to `n` using the formula `n*(n+1)/2`. This formula is a well-known mathematical formula for calculating the sum of an arithmetic series.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the function works:

1. The function takes an integer `n` as input.
2. The function returns the result of the expression `n*(n+1)/2`.

Now, let's analyze the provided assertion statement:

```c
assert (sum_to_n(30) == 465);
```

To determine whether this assertion passes or fails, we need to calculate the result of `sum_to_n(30)` and compare it to `465`.

Using the formula `n*(n+1)/2`, we can calculate the result as follows:

`sum_to_n(30) = 30*(30+1)/2 = 30*31/2 = 465`

Therefore, the result of `sum_to_n(30)` is indeed `465`, which matches the expected value in the assertion statement.

### Analysis of the Assertion Statement

The assertion statement `assert (sum_to_n(100) == 5050);` checks whether the result of calling `sum_to_n(100)` is equal to 5050.

To evaluate this assertion, we need to calculate the result of `sum_to_n(100)`:

`sum_to_n(100) = 100 * (100 + 1) / 2`
`sum_to_n(100) = 100 * 101 / 2`
`sum_to_n(100) = 10100 / 2`
`sum_to_n(100) = 5050`

Since the result of `sum_to_n(100)` is indeed 5050, the assertion will pass.
