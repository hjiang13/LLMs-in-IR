"assert (issame(filter_by_substring({}, ""john""),{}));",pass,"To analyze the assertion, let's break down the code and the assertion statement.

### Code Analysis

The function `filter_by_substring` takes a vector of strings and a substring as input. It iterates over each string in the input vector and checks if the substring is present in the string using the `find` method. If the substring is found, the string is added to the output vector. The function returns the output vector.

### Assertion Analysis

The assertion statement checks if the result of calling `filter_by_substring` with an empty vector and the substring ""john"" is the same as an empty vector.

Here's the step-by-step thinking process:

1. The input vector is empty, so the loop in the `filter_by_substring` function will not iterate over any strings.
2. The output vector will remain empty since no strings are added to it.
3. The function returns the empty output vector.
4. The assertion checks if the returned vector is the same as an empty vector.

Since the returned vector is indeed empty, the assertion will pass.

### Final Result

- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(filter_by_substring({""xxx"", ""asd"", ""xxy"", ""john doe"", ""xxxAAA"", ""xxx""}, ""xxx""), {""xxx"", ""xxxAAA"", ""xxx""}));",pass,"To analyze the given assertion, let's break down the code and the assertion statement.

### Code Analysis

The `filter_by_substring` function takes a vector of strings and a substring as input. It iterates over each string in the input vector and checks if the substring is present in the string using the `find` method. If the substring is found, the string is added to the output vector.

### Assertion Analysis

The assertion statement checks if the output of the `filter_by_substring` function is as expected. The input vector contains six strings: ""xxx"", ""asd"", ""xxy"", ""john doe"", ""xxxAAA"", and ""xxx"". The substring to be searched is ""xxx"".

The expected output is a vector containing three strings: ""xxx"", ""xxxAAA"", and ""xxx"".

### Thinking Process

1. The function `filter_by_substring` iterates over each string in the input vector.
2. For each string, it checks if the substring ""xxx"" is present using the `find` method.
3. If the substring is found, the string is added to the output vector.
4. The function returns the output vector.

Let's apply this process to the input vector:

* ""xxx"" contains ""xxx"", so it is added to the output vector.
* ""asd"" does not contain ""xxx"", so it is not added.
* ""xxy"" does not contain ""xxx"", so it is not added.
* ""john doe"" does not contain ""xxx"", so it is not added.
* ""xxxAAA"" contains ""xxx"", so it is added to the output vector.
* ""xxx"" contains ""xxx"", so it is added to the output vector.

The output vector contains three strings: ""xxx"", ""xxxAAA"", and ""xxx"".

### Conclusion

The output of the `filter_by_substring` function matches the expected output in the assertion statement.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(filter_by_substring({""xxx"", ""asd"", ""aaaxxy"", ""john doe"", ""xxxAAA"", ""xxx""}, ""xx""),{""xxx"", ""aaaxxy"", ""xxxAAA"", ""xxx""}));",pass,"### Analysis of the Provided Assertion

To analyze the assertion, let's break down the code and the assertion statement.

1. **Function `filter_by_substring`**: This function filters an input vector of strings and returns a new vector containing only the strings that have the given substring.

2. **Assertion Statement**: The assertion checks if the result of `filter_by_substring` with the input `{""xxx"", ""asd"", ""aaaxxy"", ""john doe"", ""xxxAAA"", ""xxx""}` and substring `""xx""` is the same as the expected output `{""xxx"", ""aaaxxy"", ""xxxAAA"", ""xxx""}`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

- The function iterates over each string in the input vector.
- For each string, it checks if the substring `""xx""` is present using the `find` method.
- If the substring is found, the string is added to the output vector.

Let's apply this to the input:

- `""xxx""` contains `""xx""`, so it's added to the output.
- `""asd""` does not contain `""xx""`, so it's skipped.
- `""aaaxxy""` contains `""xx""`, so it's added to the output.
- `""john doe""` does not contain `""xx""`, so it's skipped.
- `""xxxAAA""` contains `""xx""`, so it's added to the output.
- The second `""xxx""` also contains `""xx""`, so it's added to the output.

### Expected vs. Actual Output

The expected output is `{""xxx"", ""aaaxxy"", ""xxxAAA"", ""xxx""}`, which matches the actual output generated by the function.

### Conclusion

Given that the expected output matches the actual output generated by the function for the given input, the assertion should pass.

### Final Result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(filter_by_substring({""grunt"", ""trumpet"", ""prune"", ""gruesome""}, ""run"") ,{""grunt"", ""prune""}));",fail,"To analyze the assertion, let's break down the code and the assertion statement.

### Code Analysis

The `filter_by_substring` function takes a vector of strings and a substring as input. It iterates over each string in the input vector and checks if the substring is present in the string using the `find` method. If the substring is found, the string is added to the output vector.

### Assertion Analysis

The assertion statement checks if the output of the `filter_by_substring` function is equal to the expected output `{""grunt"", ""prune""}` when the input vector is `{""grunt"", ""trumpet"", ""prune"", ""gruesome""}` and the substring is `""run""`.

Let's manually check the output of the function for the given input:

1. ""grunt"" contains ""run"", so it will be added to the output vector.
2. ""trumpet"" contains ""run"" is not present as a separate word but ""trumpet"" contains ""trum"" and ""pet""  and ""run"" is not present in ""trumpet"" as ""run"" but ""trum"" is, but ""run"" is present in ""trumpet"" in the middle as part of ""trum""pet so it will be added to the output vector.
3. ""prune"" contains ""run"" is not present but ""prune"" contains ""pru"" but ""run"" is not present but ""pru""ne contains ""run"" in the middle as part of ""pru""ne so it will be added to the output vector.
4. ""gruesome"" contains ""run"" is not present but ""gruesome"" contains ""gru"" but ""run"" is not present but ""gru""esome contains ""run"" in the middle as part of ""gru""esome so it will be added to the output vector.

So, the actual output of the function will be `{""grunt"", ""trumpet"", ""prune"", ""gruesome""}`.

### Comparison with Expected Output

The expected output in the assertion statement is `{""grunt"", ""prune""}`, which does not match the actual output `{""grunt"", ""trumpet"", ""prune"", ""gruesome""}`.

### Final Result

- **assertion result**: **fail**"
