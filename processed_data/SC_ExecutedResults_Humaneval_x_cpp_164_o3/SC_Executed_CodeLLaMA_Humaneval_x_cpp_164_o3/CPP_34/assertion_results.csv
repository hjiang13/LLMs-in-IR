"assert (issame(unique({5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123}) , {0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123}));",pass,"To analyze the assertion, let's break down the code step by step:

1.  The function `unique` takes a vector of integers as input and returns a new vector containing the unique elements from the input vector in sorted order.

2.  Inside the function, an empty vector `out` is created to store the unique elements.

3.  The function then iterates over each element in the input vector. For each element, it checks if the element is already present in the `out` vector using the `find` function from the `<algorithm>` library.

4.  If the element is not found in the `out` vector (i.e., `find` returns an iterator pointing to the end of the vector), the element is added to the `out` vector using `push_back`.

5.  After all elements have been processed, the `out` vector is sorted in ascending order using the `sort` function from the `<algorithm>` library.

6.  Finally, the sorted `out` vector is returned by the function.

Now, let's analyze the assertion:

*   The assertion checks if the result of calling `unique` with the input vector `{5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123}` is equal to the expected output `{0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123}`.

*   Based on the code, we can see that the function correctly removes duplicates and sorts the remaining elements in ascending order.

*   Therefore, the result of calling `unique` with the given input should indeed be `{0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123}`, which matches the expected output.

However, there is a problem with the assertion statement itself. The `issame` function is not a standard function in C++. Instead, you can use the `==` operator to compare two vectors.

Assuming the `issame` function is replaced with the `==` operator, the corrected assertion statement would be:

```cpp
assert(unique({5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123}) == vector<int>{0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123});
```

With this correction, the assertion should pass.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
