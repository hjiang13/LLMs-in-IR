assert (is_prime(6) == false);,pass,"To analyze the assertion statement, let's break down the code and the assertion:

1. The function `is_prime(long long n)` checks if a given number `n` is prime or not.
2. The function first checks if `n` is less than 2. If it is, the function immediately returns `false`, because prime numbers are greater than 1.
3. If `n` is not less than 2, the function then enters a `for` loop, which iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive).
4. Inside the loop, the function checks if `n` is divisible by the current number `i` by using the modulo operator (`n%i==0`). If `n` is divisible by `i`, the function returns `false`, because `n` is not a prime number.
5. If the loop completes without finding any divisors of `n`, the function returns `true`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

Now, let's analyze the assertion statement:

```
assert (is_prime(6) == false);
```

In this assertion, we are checking if the function `is_prime(6)` returns `false`. 

We know that 6 is not a prime number, because it has divisors other than 1 and itself (2 and 3). Therefore, when we call `is_prime(6)`, the function will return `false`.

So, the assertion `assert (is_prime(6) == false)` will pass, because `is_prime(6)` indeed returns `false`.

assert (is_prime(101) == true);,pass,"To analyze the assertion, let's break down the code and the assertion statement.

### Code Analysis

The `is_prime` function checks if a given number `n` is prime or not. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. The function first checks if the number `n` is less than 2. If it is, the function immediately returns `false`, because prime numbers are greater than 1.

2. If `n` is not less than 2, the function enters a `for` loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). The loop uses `i*i <= n` as the condition to ensure that `i` does not exceed the square root of `n`.

3. Inside the loop, the function checks if `n` is divisible by `i` by using the condition `n % i == 0`. If `n` is divisible by `i`, the function returns `false`, indicating that `n` is not a prime number.

4. If the loop completes without finding any divisors of `n`, the function returns `true`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

### Assertion Analysis

The assertion statement is `assert (is_prime(101) == true);`. To evaluate this assertion, we need to determine if the `is_prime` function returns `true` for the input `101`.

Based on the code analysis, we can see that `101` is not less than 2, so the function will enter the `for` loop. However, `101` is a prime number, and the loop will not find any divisors of `101`. Therefore, the function will return `true`.

Since the assertion statement expects the `is_prime` function to return `true` for the input `101`, the assertion will pass.

assert (is_prime(11) == true);,pass,"### Analysis of the Provided C/C++ Code

The given C/C++ code defines a function `is_prime` that checks whether a given number is prime or not. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. The function `is_prime` takes a `long long` integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is prime or not.

2. The function first checks if `n` is less than 2. If this condition is true, the function immediately returns `false`, as prime numbers are greater than 1.

3. If `n` is not less than 2, the function enters a `for` loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). The loop uses the condition `i*i <= n` to avoid unnecessary iterations beyond the square root of `n`, as any factor larger than the square root would have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root.

4. Inside the loop, the function checks if `n` is divisible by the current iteration `i` by using the condition `n % i == 0`. If this condition is true, the function immediately returns `false`, indicating that `n` is not a prime number.

5. If the loop completes without finding any divisors, the function returns `true`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

### Analysis of the Assertion Statement

The given assertion statement is:
```c
assert (is_prime(11) == true);
```
To evaluate this assertion, we need to execute the `is_prime` function with the input `11`.

Following the steps outlined above:

1. `n` (11) is not less than 2, so the function proceeds to the `for` loop.

2. The loop iterates from 2 to the square root of 11 (approximately 3.32). The loop checks divisibility for `i` values 2 and 3.

3. Since 11 is not divisible by 2 or 3, the loop completes without finding any divisors.

4. The function returns `true`, indicating that 11 is a prime number.

### Final Result

Since the `is_prime` function correctly identifies 11 as a prime number, the assertion statement passes.

1. It first checks if the number `n` is less than 2. If it is, the function immediately returns `false`, because prime numbers are greater than 1.

2. If `n` is not less than 2, the function then enters a `for` loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). The loop checks if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers.

3. If `n` is divisible by any of the numbers in the loop, the function immediately returns `false`, because prime numbers are only divisible by 1 and themselves.

4. If the loop completes without finding any divisors, the function returns `true`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

### Assertion Analysis

Now, let's analyze the assertion statement:

```c
assert (is_prime(13441) == true);
```

This assertion checks whether the number 13441 is prime or not. If the `is_prime` function returns `true` for this number, the assertion passes; otherwise, it fails.

### Prime Number Check

To verify the assertion, we need to check whether 13441 is indeed a prime number. We can do this manually or using the `is_prime` function itself.

Upon checking, we find that 13441 is actually a prime number.

2. If the number `n` is 2 or greater, the function enters a `for` loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). The loop checks if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers by using the modulo operator (`%`). If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, the function immediately returns `false`, because `n` is not a prime number.

3. If the loop completes without finding any divisors, the function returns `true`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

### Assertion Analysis

The assertion statement is `assert (is_prime(61) == true);`. To evaluate this assertion, we need to determine if the `is_prime` function returns `true` for the input `61`.

Based on the code analysis, we can see that:

* `61` is greater than 2, so the function will enter the `for` loop.
* The loop will iterate from 2 to the square root of `61` (approximately 7.81). However, `61` is not divisible by any of these numbers (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).

3. If `n` is 2 or greater, the function then checks for divisibility from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). This is because a larger factor of `n` would be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.
4. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, the function returns `false`, indicating that `n` is not a prime number.
5. If `n` is not divisible by any of these numbers, the function returns `true`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

Now, let's analyze the assertion statement:

In this assertion, we are checking if the function `is_prime(4)` returns `false`.

2. If the number `n` is 2 or greater, the function then enters a `for` loop, which iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive).

In this assertion, we are checking if the function `is_prime` returns `false` when the input is 1. According to the code, if the input `n` is less than 2, the function returns `false`. Since 1 is less than 2, the function will return `false`.

2. The loop checks if `5` is divisible by any numbers from 2 to the square root of `5` (which is approximately 2.24). Since the square root of `5` is less than 3, the loop only checks divisibility by 2.

3. Since `5` is not divisible by 2, the loop completes without finding any divisors, and the function returns `true`.

1. `n` is not less than 2, so we enter the `for` loop.
2. The loop iterates from `i = 2` to the square root of `11` (approximately 3.32). Since `11` is not divisible by `2`, `3`, or any other number in this range, the loop completes without finding a divisor.

1. `17` is not less than `2`, so we enter the `for` loop.
