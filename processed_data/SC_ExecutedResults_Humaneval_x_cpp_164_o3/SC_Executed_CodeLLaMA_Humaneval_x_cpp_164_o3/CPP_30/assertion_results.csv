"assert (issame(get_positive({-1, -2, 4, 5, 6}) , {4, 5, 6} ));",pass,"To analyze the assertion statement, let's break down the code and the assertion:

1. The function `get_positive` takes a vector of floats as input and returns a new vector containing only the positive numbers from the input vector.

2. The assertion statement checks if the output of `get_positive({-1, -2, 4, 5, 6})` is the same as the vector `{4, 5, 6}`.

Here's the step-by-step execution of the `get_positive` function with the input `{-1, -2, 4, 5, 6}`:

- Initialize an empty vector `out`.
- Iterate through the input vector `{-1, -2, 4, 5, 6}`.
- For each number, check if it's greater than 0.
- If a number is greater than 0, add it to the `out` vector.
- After iterating through all numbers, return the `out` vector.

So, for the input `{-1, -2, 4, 5, 6}`, the `out` vector will be `{4, 5, 6}`.

However, there is a problem with the assertion statement. The `issame` function is not a standard C++ function. It seems like it should be checking if two vectors are equal, but this function does not exist in the provided code.

Assuming the `issame` function is replaced with a correct implementation, such as comparing the vectors using the `==` operator, the assertion statement would pass because the output of `get_positive({-1, -2, 4, 5, 6})` is indeed `{4, 5, 6}`.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"

### Code Analysis

The `get_positive` function takes a vector of floats as input and returns a new vector containing only the positive numbers from the input vector.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the function does:

1. It initializes an empty vector `out` to store the positive numbers.
2. It iterates over each element `l[i]` in the input vector `l`.
3. If the current element `l[i]` is greater than 0, it adds that element to the `out` vector using `push_back`.
4. Finally, it returns the `out` vector containing the positive numbers.

### Assertion Analysis

The assertion statement checks if the output of the `get_positive` function is the same as the expected output.

Here's the input vector: `{5, 3, -5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10}`

Let's apply the `get_positive` function to this input vector:

1. `5` is positive, so it's added to the output vector.
2. `3` is positive, so it's added to the output vector.
3. `-5` is not positive, so it's skipped.
4. `2` is positive, so it's added to the output vector.
5. `3` is positive, so it's added to the output vector.
6. `3` is positive, so it's added to the output vector.
7. `9` is positive, so it's added to the output vector.
8. `0` is not positive, so it's skipped.
9. `123` is positive, so it's added to the output vector.
10. `1` is positive, so it's added to the output vector.
11. `-10` is not positive, so it's skipped.

The resulting output vector is: `{5, 3, 2, 3, 3, 9, 123, 1}`

Now, let's compare this output vector with the expected output vector in the assertion statement: `{5, 3, 2, 3, 3, 9, 123, 1}`

They match!

### Assertion Analysis

The assertion statement is:
```c
assert (issame(get_positive({-1, -2}) , {} ));
```
Here, we're calling the `get_positive` function with a vector containing two negative numbers, `-1` and `-2`. We expect the function to return an empty vector `{}` since there are no positive numbers in the input vector.

However, there's a small issue: the `issame` function is not defined in the provided code. Assuming it's a function that checks if two vectors are identical, we can proceed with the analysis.

### Expected Result

Based on the code analysis, the `get_positive` function should return an empty vector `{}` when given a vector containing only negative numbers. Therefore, the assertion should pass.

### Final Result

- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(get_positive({}) , {}));",pass,"To analyze the assertion statement, let's break it down step by step:

1. The `get_positive` function takes a vector of floats as input and returns a new vector containing only the positive numbers from the input vector.

2. The assertion statement `assert (issame(get_positive({}) , {}));` is checking if the output of `get_positive({})` is an empty vector.

3. Since the input vector to `get_positive` is empty, the function will not find any positive numbers to add to the output vector.

4. As a result, the output vector will also be empty.

5. The `issame` function is not a standard C++ function, but assuming it checks if two vectors are identical, the assertion statement is essentially checking if an empty vector is equal to another empty vector.

6. Since an empty vector is indeed equal to another empty vector, the assertion statement should pass.

However, there is a problem here. The `issame` function is not defined in the given code. Therefore, this code will not compile.

If we assume that `issame` is defined somewhere else in the code and it correctly checks if two vectors are identical, then the assertion would pass.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass** (assuming `issame` is correctly defined elsewhere)"
