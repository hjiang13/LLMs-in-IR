"assert (issame(rolling_max({}),{}));",pass,"To analyze the assertion, let's break down the code and the assertion statement.

### Code Analysis

The `rolling_max` function takes a vector of integers as input and returns a vector of integers. It initializes an empty vector `out` to store the rolling maximum elements and a variable `max` to keep track of the maximum element seen so far.

The function then iterates over the input vector. If the current element is greater than the current maximum, it updates the maximum. In each iteration, it appends the current maximum to the `out` vector.

### Assertion Analysis

The assertion statement checks if the result of calling `rolling_max` with an empty vector is the same as an empty vector.

However, there is a problem with the assertion statement. The `issame` function is not defined in the provided code. Assuming that `issame` is a function that checks if two vectors are identical, let's proceed with the analysis.

### Expected Behavior

When `rolling_max` is called with an empty vector, the function should return an empty vector. This is because the loop inside the function will not execute, and the `out` vector will remain empty.

### Actual Behavior

The `rolling_max` function will indeed return an empty vector when called with an empty vector. However, the `max` variable will not be initialized correctly in this case, as it will be set to 0. But since the loop doesn't execute, this doesn't affect the output.

### Assertion Result

Assuming the `issame` function works correctly, the assertion will pass because `rolling_max` returns an empty vector when called with an empty vector.

### final result
                - **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(rolling_max({1, 2, 3, 4}) , {1, 2, 3, 4}));",pass,"### Analysis of the Provided C/C++ Code

The given C/C++ code defines a function `rolling_max` that takes a vector of integers as input and returns a new vector containing the rolling maximum element found until each moment in the sequence.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the function works:

1. It initializes an empty vector `out` to store the rolling maximum elements.
2. It initializes a variable `max` to 0, which will keep track of the maximum element encountered so far.
3. The function then iterates over each element in the input vector `numbers`.
4. For each element, it checks if the current element is greater than the current maximum `max`. If it is, it updates `max` to the current element.
5. Regardless of whether `max` was updated or not, the function appends the current value of `max` to the `out` vector.
6. Finally, the function returns the `out` vector containing the rolling maximum elements.

### Analysis of the Assertion Statement

The assertion statement checks if the result of calling `rolling_max` with the input `{1, 2, 3, 4}` is equal to the expected output `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.

Let's manually compute the rolling maximum for the input `{1, 2, 3, 4}`:

1. Initially, `max` is 0.
2. The first element is 1, which is greater than `max`. So, `max` becomes 1, and the first element of the output vector is 1.
3. The second element is 2, which is greater than `max`. So, `max` becomes 2, and the second element of the output vector is 2.
4. The third element is 3, which is greater than `max`. So, `max` becomes 3, and the third element of the output vector is 3.
5. The fourth element is 4, which is greater than `max`. So, `max` becomes 4, and the fourth element of the output vector is 4.

Therefore, the output of `rolling_max` for the input `{1, 2, 3, 4}` is indeed `{1, 2, 3, 4}`, which matches the expected output.

### Final Result

- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(rolling_max({4, 3, 2, 1}),{4, 4, 4, 4}));",pass,"To analyze the assertion, let's break down the code and the assertion statement.

### Code Analysis

The `rolling_max` function takes a vector of integers as input and returns a vector of integers. It initializes an empty vector `out` to store the rolling maximum elements and a variable `max` to keep track of the maximum element seen so far.

The function iterates over the input vector, and for each element, it checks if the current element is greater than the current maximum. If it is, it updates the maximum. Then, it appends the current maximum to the `out` vector.

### Assertion Analysis

The assertion statement checks if the output of the `rolling_max` function for the input `{4, 3, 2, 1}` is equal to `{4, 4, 4, 4}`.

Let's manually execute the `rolling_max` function for the given input:

1. Initialize `max` to 0 and `out` to an empty vector.
2. Iterate over the input vector:
	* `numbers[0]` is 4, which is greater than `max` (0). Update `max` to 4 and append 4 to `out`. `out` is now `{4}`.
	* `numbers[1]` is 3, which is less than `max` (4). Append 4 to `out`. `out` is now `{4, 4}`.
	* `numbers[2]` is 2, which is less than `max` (4). Append 4 to `out`. `out` is now `{4, 4, 4}`.
	* `numbers[3]` is 1, which is less than `max` (4). Append 4 to `out`. `out` is now `{4, 4, 4, 4}`.

The output of the `rolling_max` function for the input `{4, 3, 2, 1}` is indeed `{4, 4, 4, 4}`, which matches the expected output in the assertion statement.

### Final Result

- **assertion result**: **pass**"
"assert (issame(rolling_max({3, 2, 3, 100, 3}) ,{3, 3, 3, 100, 100}));",pass,"### Analysis of the Provided C/C++ Code

The given function `rolling_max` is designed to generate a vector of rolling maximum elements found until a given moment in the sequence. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

1.  It initializes an empty vector `out` to store the rolling maximum elements and a variable `max` to keep track of the maximum element encountered so far.
2.  The function then iterates through each element in the input vector `numbers`.
3.  For each element, it checks if the current element is greater than the current maximum `max`. If it is, it updates `max` with the current element's value.
4.  Regardless of whether `max` was updated or not, the current value of `max` is appended to the `out` vector.
5.  Once all elements in the input vector have been processed, the function returns the `out` vector, which contains the rolling maximum elements.

### Analysis of the Assertion Statement

Now, let's analyze the assertion statement:

```cpp
assert (issame(rolling_max({3, 2, 3, 100, 3}) ,{3, 3, 3, 100, 100}));
```

To determine whether this assertion passes or fails, we need to apply the `rolling_max` function to the input vector `{3, 2, 3, 100, 3}` and compare the result with the expected output `{3, 3, 3, 100, 100}`.

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1.  Initialize `max` to 0 and `out` to an empty vector.
2.  Process the first element (3): Since 3 is greater than `max` (0), update `max` to 3 and append 3 to `out`, resulting in `out = {3}`.
3.  Process the second element (2): Since 2 is not greater than `max` (3), `max` remains 3, and append 3 to `out`, resulting in `out = {3, 3}`.
4.  Process the third element (3): Since 3 is equal to `max` (3), `max` remains 3, and append 3 to `out`, resulting in `out = {3, 3, 3}`.
5.  Process the fourth element (100): Since 100 is greater than `max` (3), update `max` to 100 and append 100 to `out`, resulting in `out = {3, 3, 3, 100}`.
6.  Process the fifth element (3): Since 3 is not greater than `max` (100), `max` remains 100, and append 100 to `out`, resulting in `out = {3, 3, 3, 100, 100}`.

The resulting vector `out` matches the expected output `{3, 3, 3, 100, 100}`.

### Final Result

-   **assertion result**: **pass**"
