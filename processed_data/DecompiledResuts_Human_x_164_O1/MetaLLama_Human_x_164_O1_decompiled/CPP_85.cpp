Based on the provided LLVM IR code, I will generate the equivalent C source code. Here it is:

```c
#include <vector>

int add(std::vector<int> v) {
  int* begin = v._M_impl._M_start;
  int* end = v._M_impl._M_finish;
  int size = (end - begin) / 4;
  int sum = 0;
  if (size > 1) {
    int limit = (size - 2) / 2;
    for (int i = 0; i <= limit; i++) {
      int* ptr = begin + (i * 2 + 1);
      int val = *ptr;
      if ((val & 1) == 0) {
        sum += val;
      }
    }
  }
  return sum;
}
```

Please note that the generated C code is not guaranteed to be fully compatible with all C compilers, as it uses some internal implementation details of the `std::vector` class, which may vary depending on the compiler and library implementation. However, this code should work with most modern C++ compilers.
