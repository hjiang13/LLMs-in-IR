Based on the provided LLVM IR code, I will generate the equivalent C source code. Here it is:

```c
#include <stdint.h>

typedef struct {
    void* _Alloc_hider;
    int64_t _M_size;
    union {
        int64_t _M_capacity;
        char _M_data[8];
    } _M_data_and_capacity;
} std_string;

int32_t strlen(std_string* s) {
    return (int32_t)s->_M_size;
}
```

Please note that the generated C code might not be fully compatible with the original C++ code, as some information is lost during the conversion from C++ to LLVM IR. Additionally, the generated code may require adjustments to work correctly in a specific C environment.
