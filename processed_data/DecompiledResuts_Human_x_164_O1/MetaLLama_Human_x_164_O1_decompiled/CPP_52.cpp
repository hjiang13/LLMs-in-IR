Based on the provided LLVM IR code, I will generate the corresponding C source code. Here it is:

```c
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdint.h>

bool below_threshold(int* data, int size, int threshold) {
    int64_t length = (int64_t)(data + size) - (int64_t)data;
    length >>= 2;

    if (length == 0) {
        return true;
    }

    int64_t max = __builtin_umaxll(length, 1);
    int64_t i = 1;

    do {
        if (data[i - 1] >= threshold) {
            return false;
        }
        i++;
    } while (i <= max);

    return length > max;
}
```

Please note that this C code might not be exactly what the original C++ code looked like, since LLVM IR can be generated from various programming languages and the original code's structure might not be preserved. However, this C code should have the same functionality as the provided LLVM IR code. 

Also note that the original LLVM IR code appears to be using C++ Standard Library's `std::vector`, but I've replaced it with a simple C-style array and its size, since C does not have a direct equivalent of `std::vector`. The generated C code assumes that the input array `data` has at least `size` elements.
