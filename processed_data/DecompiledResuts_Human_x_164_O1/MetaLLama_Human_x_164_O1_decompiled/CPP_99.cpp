Based on the provided LLVM IR568 code, here's the equivalent C source code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int closest_integer(const char* str) {
    double num = strtod(str, NULL);
    return (int)round(num);
}
```

Please note that this C code is a direct translation of the provided LLVM IR568 code. The original C++ code that generated this IR likely used the `std::string` class, which has been replaced with a `const char*` in this C version, as C does not have a direct equivalent to `std::string`. The `strtod` function is used to convert the string to a double, and the `round` function is used to round the double to the nearest integer.
