Based on the provided LLVM IR code, I will generate the corresponding C source code. Here it is:

```c
long special_factorial(int n) {
    if (n < 1) {
        return 1;
    }

    long result = 1;
    long i = 1;
    long mul1 = 1;
    long mul2 = 1;

    while (i < (long)(n + 1)) {
        mul1 *= i;
        result = mul1 * mul2;
        mul2 = result;
        i++;
    }

    return result;
}
```

Please note that the generated C code may not be perfect and may require some manual optimization or modification to match the original code's behavior. Additionally, some variable names have been chosen arbitrarily, as the IR code does not provide any information about the original variable names. 

However, the generated code should provide the same functionality as the IR code. If you need further modifications or optimizations, please let me know.
