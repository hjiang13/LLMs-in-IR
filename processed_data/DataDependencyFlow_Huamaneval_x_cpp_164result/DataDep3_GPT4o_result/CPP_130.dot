### Analysis of Dependencies in the Provided IR Code

The provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code defines a function `_Z3trii` which performs various operations on variables and memory. The task is to identify data dependencies among the defined variables and functions within this IR code.

#### Key Points of Analysis:

1. **Variables Identified**:
   - The function uses several variables, notably `%1`, `%4`, `%6`, `%30`, `%31`, `%32`, `%33`, etc. These variables are used in various operations such as storing, loading, and arithmetic computations.
   
2. **Data Dependencies**:
   - Many variables depend on the results of previous computations (e.g., `%4` is loaded from `%30`, etc.).
   - The phi nodes, such as `%131`, `%132`, and `%133`, indicate that they can take values from multiple predecessors, which also suggests dependencies on various branches of control flow.
   - The analysis focuses on whether any variable influences the value of another through operations like `store`, `load`, `add`, and `icmp`.

3. **Functions and Their Influence**:
   - The function `_Z3trii` is the only defined function in this code, and it contains internal logic impacting its own variables.

Based on the analysis, we can conclude that there are data dependencies within the function itself, particularly related to the phi nodes and the variables interacting through stores and loads.

### DOT File Representation of Dependencies

The following DOT file represents the data flow graph of the dependencies identified in the IR code:

```dot
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    "function:_Z3trii:%1" [label="Variable %1 in _Z3trii"];
    "function:_Z3trii:%4" [label="Variable %4 in _Z3trii"];
    "function:_Z3trii:%6" [label="Variable %6 in _Z3trii"];
    "function:_Z3trii:%30" [label="Variable %30 in _Z3trii"];
    "function:_Z3trii:%31" [label="Variable %31 in _Z3trii"];
    "function:_Z3trii:%32" [label="Variable %32 in _Z3trii"];
    "function:_Z3trii:%33" [label="Variable %33 in _Z3trii"];
    
    "function:_Z3trii:%4" -> "function:_Z3trii:%1" [label="yes"];
    "function:_Z3trii:%6" -> "function:_Z3trii:%4" [label="yes"];
    "function:_Z3trii:%30" -> "function:_Z3trii:%31" [label="yes"];
    "function:_Z3trii:%31" -> "function:_Z3trii:%32" [label="yes"];
    "function:_Z3trii:%32" -> "function:_Z3trii:%33" [label="yes"];
}
```

### Summary of Findings

- The function has various data dependencies that are internal, meaning all variables are part of the same function and influence each other.
- There are no dependencies with other functions since none exist in the provided IR code.
- The edge labels indicate that the dependencies exist (`yes`) due to the use of `store` and `load` operations among variables.

This concludes the analysis and representation of data dependencies in the provided IR code.
