### Analysis of the Provided IR Code

The provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code is complex and contains several variables and functions, primarily related to string manipulations and memory management. Let's break down the key variables and analyze their dependencies.

**Identified Variables**:
- Variables within the function `_Z15string_sequenceB5cxx11i`:
  - `%0`: Input parameter (pointer to `basic_string`)
  - `%1`: Input parameter (integer)
  - `%3`, `%4`, `%5`, `%6`: Allocated variables (pointers to `basic_string`)
  - `%7` to `%35`: Various intermediate variables used for operations and memory management.
  
- Variables in the function `_ZN9__gnu_cxx12__to_xstringINSt7__cxx1112basic_string...`:
  - `%0`: Input parameter (pointer to `basic_string`)
  - `%1`: Input parameter (function pointer)
  - `%2`: Input parameter (integer)
  - `%5`, `%6`, `%7`, `%8`: Allocated variables for operations.

### Dependency Analysis

1. **Within Function `_Z15string_sequenceB5cxx11i`**:
   - The variable `%0` is used extensively to manipulate the `basic_string`, influencing various allocations and stores.
   - The variable `%1` is used to control flow and indexing, particularly in conditional statements.
   - Variables such as `%3`, `%4`, `%5`, and `%6` are allocated and manipulated in a way that they depend on the values and structure of `%0`.

2. **Between Functions**:
   - The first function (`_Z15string_sequenceB5cxx11i`) and the second function (`_ZN9__gnu_cxx12__to_xstringINSt7__cxx1112basic_string...`) do not directly share variables or manipulate the same data. Thus, they do not have data dependencies on each other.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the variables within each function exhibit data dependencies among themselves, particularly through the use of pointers and storage operations. However, there are no dependencies between the two functions.

    "to_xstring:%6" [label="Variable %6 in to_xstring"];
    "to_xstring:%7" [label="Variable %7 in to_xstring"];
    
    // Dependencies within string_sequence function
    "string_sequence:%0" -> "string_sequence:%3";
    "string_sequence:%0" -> "string_sequence:%4";
    "string_sequence:%0" -> "string_sequence:%5";
    "string_sequence:%0" -> "string_sequence:%6";
    "string_sequence:%1" -> "string_sequence:%3";
    
    // Dependencies within to_xstring function
    "to_xstring:%0" -> "to_xstring:%1";
    "to_xstring:%0" -> "to_xstring:%2";
    "to_xstring:%1" -> "to_xstring:%5";
    "to_xstring:%5" -> "to_xstring:%6";
}
```

### Labels for Variables:
- Data-dependent relationships are represented by arrows in the DOT file, indicating how one variable influences another within the same function.
- As analyzed, there is no data dependency between the two functions, hence no connections between them in the DOT representation.
