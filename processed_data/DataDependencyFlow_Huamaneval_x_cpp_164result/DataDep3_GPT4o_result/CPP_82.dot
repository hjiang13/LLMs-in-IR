To analyze the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will extract variables and analyze their dependencies. Here's the breakdown of the analysis:

1. **Identify Variables and Functions**:
   - The function defined is `@_Z12prime_lengthNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`.
   - Variables identified within this function:
     - `%0` (input parameter)
     - `%2` (pointer to the basic string)
     - `%3` (loaded value from the pointer)
     - `%4` (truncated value of `%3`)
     - `%5` (comparison result)
     - `%7` (comparison result)
     - `%9` (phi variable)
     - `%10` (remainder)
     - `%11` (comparison result)
     - `%12` (incremented value of `%9`)
     - `%13` (square of `%12`)
     - `%14` (comparison result)
     - `%15` (select result)
     - `%17` (xor result)
     - `%19` (final return value)

2. **Analyze Dependencies**:
   - Analyzing the dependencies:
     - `%3` is dependent on `%0` because it loads from the address calculated by `%2`, which is derived from `%0`.
     - `%4` is dependent on `%3` since it is a truncation of `%3`.
     - `%5` is dependent on `%4` as it compares `%4`.
     - `%9` is derived from `%12` and `%6` (both are involved in the phi function), leading to dependencies on the values produced from previous computations.
     - `%10` is dependent on both `%4` and `%9`.
     - `%11`, `%12`, `%13`, and `%14` are all interdependent through their arithmetic operations.
     - `%15` depends on `%11` and `%14`.
     - `%19` is the final return value dependent on the result from the previous computations.

3. **Generate DOT File**:
   The following is the representation of the dependencies in DOT format:

```dot
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    "prime_length:%0" [label="Input %0"];
    "prime_length:%2" [label="Pointer %2"];
    "prime_length:%3" [label="Loaded value %3"];
    "prime_length:%4" [label="Truncated value %4"];
    "prime_length:%5" [label="Comparison result %5"];
    "prime_length:%7" [label="Comparison result %7"];
    "prime_length:%9" [label="Phi variable %9"];
    "prime_length:%10" [label="Remainder %10"];
    "prime_length:%11" [label="Comparison result %11"];
    "prime_length:%12" [label="Incremented value %12"];
    "prime_length:%13" [label="Square of %12"];
    "prime_length:%14" [label="Comparison result %14"];
    "prime_length:%15" [label="Select result %15"];
    "prime_length:%17" [label="XOR result %17"];
    "prime_length:%19" [label="Return value %19"];

    "prime_length:%0" -> "prime_length:%2" [label="yes"];
    "prime_length:%2" -> "prime_length:%3" [label="yes"];
    "prime_length:%3" -> "prime_length:%4" [label="yes"];
    "prime_length:%4" -> "prime_length:%5" [label="yes"];
    "prime_length:%4" -> "prime_length:%10" [label="yes"];
    "prime_length:%9" -> "prime_length:%10" [label="yes"];
    "prime_length:%9" -> "prime_length:%12" [label="yes"];
    "prime_length:%12" -> "prime_length:%13" [label="yes"];
    "prime_length:%12" -> "prime_length:%14" [label="yes"];
    "prime_length:%11" -> "prime_length:%15" [label="yes"];
    "prime_length:%14" -> "prime_length:%15" [label="yes"];
    "prime_length:%11" -> "prime_length:%17" [label="yes"];
    "prime_length:%17" -> "prime_length:%19" [label="yes"];
}
```

### Summary:
All the variables within the function are interdependent due to their definitions and usage, primarily through arithmetic and logical operations. Each variable's output is used as an input for subsequent computations, indicating a strong data dependency throughout the function.
