### Analysis of the Provided IR Code

In the given Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we need to identify the variables, their dependencies, and the functions they belong to. The key variables in the code are primarily pointers to `float` values, and there are several functions interacting with these variables.

### Observations

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - There are multiple functions defined in the code, including:
     - `@_Z6medianSt6vectorIfSaIfEE`
     - `@_ZSt16__introsort_loopIN9__gnu_cxx17__normal_iteratorIPfSt6vectorIfSaIfEEEElNS0_5__ops15_Iter_less_iterEEvT_S9_T0_T1_`
     - `@_ZSt22__final_insertion_sortIN9__gnu_cxx17__normal_iteratorIPfSt6vectorIfSaIfEEEENS0_5__ops15_Iter_less_iterEEvT_S9_T0_`
     - `@_ZSt11__make_heapIN9__gnu_cxx17__normal_iteratorIPfSt6vectorIfSaIfEEEENS0_5__ops15_Iter_less_iterEEvT_S9_RT0_`

2. **Variables and Dependencies**:
   - Variables such as `%3`, `%5`, `%18`, `%19`, etc., represent pointers to `float` elements. 
   - The core functionality involves accessing and manipulating these float values through various operations such as `load`, `store`, `add`, and `icmp`.

3. **Data Dependencies**:
   - Many of these variables are derived from pointer arithmetic and conditional operations. 
   - Variables like `%3` and `%5` are loaded and compared, creating a dependency between them.
   - The `phi` nodes indicate that values from different branches are merged, showing that they depend on the control flow.

4. **Cross-Function Dependencies**:
   - There are no direct dependencies between variables in different functions based on the provided IR code. Each function operates independently on its own set of variables.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, we can summarize the relationships between the variables and create a DOT file for visualization.

### DOT File Representation

```dot
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];

    "median_function:%3" [label="Variable %3 in median_function"];
    "median_function:%5" [label="Variable %5 in median_function"];
    "median_function:%18" [label="Variable %18 in median_function"];
    "median_function:%19" [label="Variable %19 in median_function"];

    "introsort_loop:%0" [label="Variable %0 in introsort_loop"];
    "introsort_loop:%1" [label="Variable %1 in introsort_loop"];
    
    "final_insertion_sort:%0" [label="Variable %0 in final_insertion_sort"];
    "final_insertion_sort:%1" [label="Variable %1 in final_insertion_sort"];
    
    "make_heap:%0" [label="Variable %0 in make_heap"];
    "make_heap:%1" [label="Variable %1 in make_heap"];

    // Add edges for data dependencies
    "median_function:%3" -> "median_function:%5" [label="load"];
    "median_function:%18" -> "median_function:%19" [label="phi"];
    
    // No cross-function dependencies
}
```

### Summary of Dependencies
- The variables `%3` and `%5` in the `median_function` are data-dependent due to the loading and comparison operations.
- The variables in the other functions are independent of those in `median_function`, leading to the conclusion that there are no cross-function dependencies.
