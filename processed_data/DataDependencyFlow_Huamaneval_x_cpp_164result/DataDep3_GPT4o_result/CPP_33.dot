### Analysis of the Given IR Code

**Variables and Functions Identified:**

1. **Functions:**
   - `@_Z10sort_thirdSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`
   - `@__gxx_personality_v0`
   - `@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8`
   - `@llvm.memset.p0i8.i64`
   - `@_ZdlPv`
   - `@_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc`
   - `@_Znwm`
   - `@llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64`
   - `@_ZSt16__introsort_loopIN9__gnu_cxx17__normal_iteratorIPiSt6vectorIiSaIiEEEElNS0_5__ops15_Iter_less_iterEEvT_S9_T0_T1_`
   - `@_ZSt22__final_insertion_sortIN9__gnu_cxx17__normal_iteratorIPiSt6vectorIiSaIiEEEENS0_5__ops15_Iter_less_iterEEvT_S9_T0_`
   - `@_ZSt11__make_heapIN9__gnu_cxx17__normal_iteratorIPiSt6vectorIiSaIiEEEENS0_5__ops15_Iter_less_iterEEvT_S9_RT0_`

2. **Variables:**
   - `%0` (input vector)
   - `%1` (readonly input vector)
   - Various `%n` variables (like `%3`, `%4`, `%5`, etc.) used in computations.
   - Temporary variables like `%9`, `%10`, `%11`, etc., which are used to hold intermediate results.

### Dependency Analysis

- The IR code presents a complex series of operations primarily involving pointers to elements within `std::vector`.
- The variables being manipulated are mainly local to the function and do not share direct dependencies with variables across different functions.
- However, due to the use of pointer arithmetic and the complexity of the operations, some variables may have indirect dependencies.

### Conclusion

After reviewing the IR code, it's apparent that:

- **Variables within the same function have data dependencies** due to the load and store instructions.
- **Variables across different functions do not have direct dependencies** since they operate independently and do not share state.

### Data Dependency Relationships

- The relationships can be summarized as follows:
  - Variables within `@_Z10sort_thirdSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` are dependent on each other due to the operations performed on them.
  - There are no dependencies between the variables of `@_Z10sort_thirdSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` and those in any other function.

### DOT File Representation

Here is the DOT file representation for the data dependencies:

```
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    "sort_third:%0" [label="Input vector %0"];
    "sort_third:%1" [label="Readonly vector %1"];
    "sort_third:%3" [label="Temporary variable %3"];
    "sort_third:%4" [label="Temporary variable %4"];
    "sort_third:%5" [label="Temporary variable %5"];
    "sort_third:%9" [label="Temporary variable %9"];
    "sort_third:%10" [label="Temporary variable %10"];
    "sort_third:%11" [label="Temporary variable %11"];
    
    // Add edges for dependencies within the function
    "sort_third:%0" -> "sort_third:%3";
    "sort_third:%1" -> "sort_third:%4";
    "sort_third:%3" -> "sort_third:%5";
    "sort_third:%4" -> "sort_third:%9";
    "sort_third:%5" -> "sort_third:%10";
    "sort_third:%10" -> "sort_third:%11";
}
```

### Summary

- **Dependency Output**: The variables within the function have dependencies, whereas dependencies across functions are absent.
- **DOT File**: It illustrates the internal state changes within the function `@_Z10sort_thirdSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`, revealing how each variable interacts with the others through load and store operations.
