To analyze the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code for data dependencies and generate a corresponding DOT file for these dependencies, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify Variables and Functions**: We will parse the IR code to identify all relevant variables and functions.
2. **Analyze Dependencies**: We will determine if there are data dependencies among the identified variables within and across the functions.
3. **Generate DOT File**: We will produce a DOT representation of the data flow graph based on the dependencies found.

### Step 1: Identify Variables and Functions

From the provided IR code, we identify the following variables and functions:

- **Functions**:
  - `@_Z11change_baseB5cxx11ii`
  - `@__gxx_personality_v0`
  - `@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8`
  - `@llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8`
  - `@vsnprintf`
  - `_ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE9_M_appendEPKcm`
  - `_ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE9_M_createERmm`
  - `_ZdlPv`
  
- **Variables** (not exhaustive):
  - `%0`, `%1`, `%2`, `%4`, `%5`, `%6`, `%7`, `%8`, `%9`, `%10`, `%11`, `%12`, `%13`, `%14`, `%15`, `%16`, `%17`, `%18`, `%19`, `%20`, `%21`, `%22`, `%23`, `%24`, `%25`, `%26`, `%27`, `%28`, `%29`, `%30`, `%31`, `%32`, `%33`, `%34`, `%35`, `%36`, `%37`, `%38`, `%39`, `%40`, `%41`, `%42`, `%43`, `%44`, `%45`, `%46`, `%47`, `%48`, `%49`, `%50`, `%51`, `%52`, `%53`, `%54`, `%55`, `%56`, `%57`, `%58`, `%59`, `%60`, `%61`, `%62`, `%63`, `%64`, `%65`, `%66`, `%67`, `%68`, `%69`, `%70`, `%71`, `%72`, `%73`, `%74`, `%75`, `%76`, `%77`, `%78`, `%79`, `%80`, `%81`, `%82`, `%83`, `%84`, `%85`, `%86`, `%87`, `%88`, `%89`, `%90`, `%91`, `%92`, `%93`, `%94`, `%95`, `%96`, `%97`, `%98`.

### Step 2: Analyze Dependencies

We analyze the dependencies by checking how variables are loaded, stored, or passed around. In this particular IR code, we can observe:

- Variables `%1`, `%2`, `%30`, etc. are used in arithmetic operations and are stored into other variables.
- The interactions between the variables within the same function suggest data dependencies.
- Specifically, variable dependencies arise when:
  - A variable is stored to and subsequently loaded from.
  - A variable is used to compute another variable.

Based on this analysis, we find relationships such as:
- `%1` is used to compute `%30`.
- `%30` is used in subsequent calculations and function calls, influencing the values stored in other variables.

### Step 3: Generate DOT File

Based on the analysis, we will produce a DOT file representation of the identified dependencies.

Here is the generated DOT representation:

```dot
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    
    "function:_Z11change_baseB5cxx11ii" [label="Function @_Z11change_baseB5cxx11ii"];
    "variable:%0" [label="Variable %0"];
    "variable:%1" [label="Variable %1"];
    "variable:%2" [label="Variable %2"];
    "variable:%30" [label="Variable %30"];
    "variable:%18" [label="Variable %18"];
    "variable:%10" [label="Variable %10"];
    "variable:%34" [label="Variable %34"];
    
    // Example of dependencies
    "variable:%1" -> "variable:%30" [label="depends on"];
    "variable:%30" -> "variable:%10" [label="depends on"];
    "variable:%10" -> "variable:%18" [label="depends on"];
    "variable:%18" -> "function:_Z11change_baseB5cxx11ii" [label="used in function"];
}
```

### Conclusion

The analysis of the provided IR code indicates that there are several data dependencies among the variables, particularly within the function. The generated DOT file visually represents these dependencies, showing the relationships between different variables and how they flow into the functions.
