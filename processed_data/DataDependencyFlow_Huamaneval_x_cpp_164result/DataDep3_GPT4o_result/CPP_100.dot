To analyze the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code and identify the data dependencies, we will follow the steps outlined in the task description. 

### Step 1: Identify Variables and Functions

From the provided IR code, we can identify the following variables and their respective functions:

- Function: `@_Z11make_a_pilei`
    - Variables:
        - `%0` (parameter: `%"class.std::vector"*`)
        - `%1` (parameter: `i32`)
        - `%3` (local variable)
        - `%4` (local variable)
        - `%5` (local variable)
        - `%6` (local variable)
        - `%7` (local variable)
        - `%8` (local variable)

        - `%21` (local variable)
        - `%22` (local variable)
        - `%23` (local variable)
        - `%24` (local variable)
        - `%25` (local variable)
        - `%26` (local variable)
        - `%27` (local variable)
        - `%28` (local variable)
        - `%29` (local variable)
        - `%30` (local variable)
        - `%31` (label)
        - `%32` (local variable)
        - `%33` (label)
        - `%34` (label)
        - `%35` (label)
        - `%36` (local variable)
        - `%37` (local variable)
        - `%38` (local variable)
        - `%39` (local variable)
        - `%40` (local variable)
        - `%41` (local variable)
        - `%42` (local variable)
        - `%43` (local variable)
        - `%44` (label)
        - `%45` (local variable)
        - `%46` (local variable)
        - `%47` (label)
        - `%48` (local variable)
        - `%49` (label)
        - `%50` (phi variable)
        - `%51` (local variable)
        - `%52` (local variable)
        - `%53` (label)
        - `%54` (local variable)
        - `%55` (local variable)
        - `%56` (label)
        - `%57` (local variable)
        - `%58` (local variable)
        - `%59` (local variable)
        - `%60` (label)
        - `%61` (phi variable)
        - `%62` (phi variable)
        - `%63` (phi variable)
        - `%64` (local variable)
        - `%65` (local variable)
        - `%66` (label)
        - `%67` (local variable)
        - `%68` (label)
        - `%69` (local variable)
        - `%70` (label)
        - `%71` (local variable)
        - `%72` (local variable)
        - `%73` (label)

### Step 2: Analyze Dependencies

Next, we will analyze the dependencies among these variables. The key points for data dependencies are:
1. If a variable is written to and then subsequently read, there exists a data dependency.
2. `phi` nodes indicate merging of different control flow paths and thus can introduce dependencies based on the control flow.

In this code, we observe the following dependencies:

- `%5` is written and then read as `%17` in the phi instruction (indicating a dependency).
- `%17` is used in the calculation of `%26`.
- `%26` is modified and written to `%18`, creating a dependency chain.

### Step 3: Generate DOT File

Now, we will produce a DOT file representation of the data flow graph of the identified dependencies:

```dot
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    "make_a_pile:%0" [label="Parameter %0 in make_a_pile"];
    "make_a_pile:%1" [label="Parameter %1 in make_a_pile"];
    "make_a_pile:%5" [label="Variable %5 in make_a_pile"];
    "make_a_pile:%17" [label="Variable %17 in make_a_pile"];
    "make_a_pile:%26" [label="Variable %26 in make_a_pile"];
    "make_a_pile:%18" [label="Variable %18 in make_a_pile"];

    // Dependencies
    "make_a_pile:%5" -> "make_a_pile:%17" [label="yes"];
    "make_a_pile:%17" -> "make_a_pile:%26" [label="yes"];
    "make_a_pile:%26" -> "make_a_pile:%18" [label="yes"];
}
```

### Summary of Analysis

- The variables `%5`, `%17`, `%26`, and `%18` exhibit data dependencies based on the operations performed in the function.
- The dependencies are clearly defined through the writes and reads of these variables.
  
The output confirms the existence of data dependencies, and the DOT file succinctly represents these relationships.
