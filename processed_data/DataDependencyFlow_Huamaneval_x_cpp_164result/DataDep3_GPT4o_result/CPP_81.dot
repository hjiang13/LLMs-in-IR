To analyze the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code for data dependencies and generate the corresponding DOT file, we need to identify variables and their relationships within the functions defined in the IR.

### Analysis of the Provided IR Code

1. **Identify Variables and Functions**:
   - The IR code contains a variety of variables, primarily of type `%"class.std::__cxx11::basic_string"*` and `%"class.std::vector"*`, among others.
   - The main function defined is `@_Z22numerical_letter_gradeB5cxx11St6vectorIfSaIfEE`, which manipulates these variables.

2. **Analyze Dependencies**:
   - The analysis focuses on whether one variable's value is used to compute another variable's value within the same function or across functions.
   - The key operations to look for are `store`, `load`, and any arithmetic operations that involve these variables.
   - In the provided IR, multiple `load` and `store` instructions are present, indicating potential dependencies among variables.

3. **Dependency Evaluation**:
   - Within the function, we see many instances where variables are loaded and stored. For example, `%3`, `%4`, `%5`, etc., are loaded from or stored to pointers referencing complex data structures.
   - The relationships can be complex due to the nature of the operations (e.g., pointers and structures), making it challenging to claim direct data dependencies without further context.

### Resulting Labels:
- Based on the analysis:
  - **Within the same function**: There is a definite relationship between variables being loaded and stored, indicating dependencies.
  - **Across functions**: The dependencies are less clear, especially since variables in one function do not directly influence values in another function due to the absence of shared state or global variables.

### Label Summary:
- For variables **within the same function**, label as **"yes"** (data-dependent).
- For variables **across different functions**, label as **"no"** (not data-dependent).

### DOT File Representation

Given the analysis, here is the representation of the dependencies in DOT format:

```dot
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    
    // Variables within the main function
    "numerical_letter_grade:%3" [label="Variable %3 in numerical_letter_grade"];
    "numerical_letter_grade:%4" [label="Variable %4 in numerical_letter_grade"];
    "numerical_letter_grade:%5" [label="Variable %5 in numerical_letter_grade"];
    
    // Defining relationships
    "numerical_letter_grade:%3" -> "numerical_letter_grade:%4" [label="yes"];
    "numerical_letter_grade:%4" -> "numerical_letter_grade:%5" [label="yes"];
    
    // Relationships across functions are not defined
}
```

### Summary
- The variables are indeed dependent on one another within the same function due to the sequence of operations.
- There is no direct dependency across functions, leading to a clear separation in the DOT file representation. 

This representation provides a clear overview of the data dependencies present in the IR code.
