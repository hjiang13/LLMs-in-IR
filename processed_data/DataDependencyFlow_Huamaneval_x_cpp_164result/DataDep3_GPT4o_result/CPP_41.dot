### Analysis of the Provided IR Code

Given the Intermediate Representation (IR) code provided, let's first identify the variables and functions, then analyze any data dependencies.

#### Identified Variables and Functions

1. **Function**: `@_Z18car_race_collisioni`
   - **Parameter**: `%0`
   - **Variable**: `%2`

#### Analyzing Dependencies

- The function `@_Z18car_race_collisioni` takes a single parameter `%0` and computes `%2` as `mul nsw i32 %0, %0`, which means `%2` is directly dependent on `%0`. 
- There are no other variables or functions defined in the provided IR code, so we cannot establish any dependencies beyond this single function.

#### Data Dependency Relationships

- **Dependency between `%0` and `%2`**: 
  - `%2` is computed based on the value of `%0`. Therefore, we can conclude that there is a data dependency relationship.

### DOT File Representation

Since there is a data dependency between `%0` and `%2`, we will represent this in a DOT file format.

```dot
Label: yes

Explanation: The variable `%2` in the function `@_Z18car_race_collisioni` is data-dependent on the parameter `%0`, as `%2` is computed using the value of `%0`.

DOT File Representation:
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    "_Z18car_race_collisioni:%0" [label="Parameter %0 in @_Z18car_race_collisioni"];
    "_Z18car_race_collisioni:%2" [label="Variable %2 in @_Z18car_race_collisioni"];
    "_Z18car_race_collisioni:%0" -> "_Z18car_race_collisioni:%2" [label="depends on"];
}
```

In this representation:
- Each node represents a variable or parameter in the function.
- An edge from `%0` to `%2` indicates that `%2` is dependent on `%0`. The label "depends on" clarifies the nature of the relationship.
