### Analysis of the Provided IR Code

#### IR Code Breakdown
The provided IR code represents a function that computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. The critical variables and their relationships are:

1. **Function Definition**: 
   - `i32 @_Z23greatest_common_divisorii(i32 %0, i32 %1)`
   - Takes two integer parameters `%0` and `%1`.

2. **Variables**:
   - `%4`, `%5`, `%6`, `%7`, `%8`, `%9`, `%10`: These are intermediate variables used within the function.

3. **Key Operations**:
   - `%4` and `%5` are defined using `phi` instructions that depend on the control flow.
   - `%6` checks if `%5` is less than `%4`.
   - `%7` and `%8` are selected based on the comparison result.
   - `%9` is the result of a remainder operation.
   - `%10` checks if `%9` equals 0.

#### Data Dependency Analysis
- **Direct Dependencies**:
  - `%4` is dependent on `%1` and `%7` (comes from `%3`).
  - `%5` is dependent on `%0` and `%9` (comes from `%3`).
  - `%6` depends on `%5` and `%4`.
  - `%7` depends on `%5` and `%4`.
  - `%8` depends on `%4` and `%5`.
  - `%9` depends on `%8` and `%7`.

- **Cross-function Dependencies**: 
  - The function is standalone, and there are no calls or references to other functions within the provided IR code, meaning there's no cross-function variable dependency.

#### Conclusion
Within the single function provided, all variables have clear data dependencies through the defined operations. No variables from other functions exist, so there are no cross-function dependencies. 

### DOT File Representation
Based on the analysis, here's the DOT file representation of the dependencies:

```dot
digraph DataDependency {
  node [shape=box];
  "greatest_common_divisor:%0" [label="Variable %0 in greatest_common_divisor"];
  "greatest_common_divisor:%1" [label="Variable %1 in greatest_common_divisor"];
  "greatest_common_divisor:%4" [label="Variable %4 in greatest_common_divisor"];
  "greatest_common_divisor:%5" [label="Variable %5 in greatest_common_divisor"];
  "greatest_common_divisor:%6" [label="Variable %6 in greatest_common_divisor"];
  "greatest_common_divisor:%7" [label="Variable %7 in greatest_common_divisor"];
  "greatest_common_divisor:%8" [label="Variable %8 in greatest_common_divisor"];
  "greatest_common_divisor:%9" [label="Variable %9 in greatest_common_divisor"];
  "greatest_common_divisor:%10" [label="Variable %10 in greatest_common_divisor"];

  "greatest_common_divisor:%4" -> "greatest_common_divisor:%6" [label="depends on"];
  "greatest_common_divisor:%5" -> "greatest_common_divisor:%6" [label="depends on"];
  "greatest_common_divisor:%5" -> "greatest_common_divisor:%7" [label="depends on"];
  "greatest_common_divisor:%4" -> "greatest_common_divisor:%7" [label="depends on"];
  "greatest_common_divisor:%8" -> "greatest_common_divisor:%9" [label="depends on"];
  "greatest_common_divisor:%7" -> "greatest_common_divisor:%9" [label="depends on"];
}
```

### Summary
- The variables in the function are data-dependent on each other as per the control flow and operations defined.
- There are no dependencies outside of this function context, and thus a single function's variable dependencies are clearly represented in the DOT file.
