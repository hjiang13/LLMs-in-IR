**Analysis of the Provided IR Code:**

The provided IR code consists of a single function `@_Z11count_up_toi`, which contains multiple variables, primarily pointers and integers, with various operations including loads, stores, and arithmetic operations.

**Identified Variables:**
- `%0` : Pointer to `"class.std::vector"`
- `%1` : Input integer parameter
- `%3`, `%4`, `%6`, `%8`, `%9`, `%10`, `%11`, `%12`, `%13`, `%14`, `%15`, `%16`, `%17`, `%18`, `%19`, `%20`, `%22`, `%23`, `%24`, `%26`, `%27`, `%28`, `%30`, `%31`, `%32`, `%33`, `%34`, `%35`, `%36`, `%37`, `%39`, `%40`, `%41`, `%43`, `%44`, `%45`, `%46`, `%47`, `%48`, `%49`, `%50`, `%51`, `%52`, `%53`, `%55`, `%56`, `%58`, `%60`, `%61`, `%62`, `%63`, `%66`, `%67`, `%68`, `%69`, `%70`, `%71`, `%72`, `%74`, `%75`, `%76`, `%78`, `%80`, `%81`, `%82`, `%84`, `%86`, `%88`, `%89`, `%90`, `%91`, `%92`, `%93`, `%96`, `%97`, `%99`, `%100`, `%102` : Various temporary variables and pointers used within the function.

**Dependency Analysis:**
1. **Within the Function**:
   - There are numerous dependencies between the variables. For instance, variables `%11`, `%12`, `%13`, `%14`, and `%15` are defined using the `phi` instructions, which indicates they can take values from different predecessors based on the control flow. 
   - Variables are loaded from and stored to each other, creating a clear flow of data between them.

2. **Across Functions**:
   - Since there are no other functions in the provided IR code, there are no cross-function dependencies to analyze.

Given this analysis, we can conclude that there are multiple data dependencies within the function, but no dependencies across functions since it is the only one present.
