To analyze the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we'll identify variables within the code, determine their dependencies, and generate a DOT file to represent these dependencies.

### Step 1: Identify Variables and Functions

From the IR code, we can locate the following functions and variables:

- **Function**: `@_Z10fix_spacesNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`
- **Variables**:
  - `%0`
  - `%1`
  - `%3` to `%57` (various local variables)
  - `%22` (loaded from `%21`)
  - `%21` (loaded from `%19`)

### Step 2: Analyze Dependencies

1. **Data Dependencies**:
   - The variable `%21` is loaded from `%22`, which indicates that `%22` influences the value of `%21`.
   - `%57` is a load operation dependent on the value stored in `%22`.
   - Variables are defined and read in various locations, showing that they depend on each other through load and store instructions.

2. **Cross-Function Dependencies**:
   - No direct dependencies across different functions are seen; all operations appear local to the single function provided.

### Step 3: Generate DOT File

Based on the dependencies observed:
- All relationships can be analyzed locally within the function, showing how the variables interact.

Here's the DOT file representation:

```dot
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    "function:_Z10fix_spacesNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE:%0" [label="Variable %0"];
    "function:_Z10fix_spacesNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE:%1" [label="Variable %1"];
    "function:_Z10fix_spacesNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE:%3" [label="Variable %3"];
    "function:_Z10fix_spacesNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE:%22" [label="Variable %22"];
    "function:_Z10fix_spacesNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE:%21" [label="Variable %21"];
    "function:_Z10fix_spacesNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE:%57" [label="Variable %57"];
    
    "function:_Z10fix_spacesNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE:%22" -> "function:_Z10fix_spacesNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE:%21" [label="depends on"];
    "function:_Z10fix_spacesNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE:%22" -> "function:_Z10fix_spacesNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE:%57" [label="depends on"];
}
```

### Final Summary

- **Overall Dependency Status**: The variables within the function have data dependencies, notably with `%22` influencing both `%21` and `%57`.
- **DOT Representation**: Provides a visual representation of these dependencies.

This concludes the analysis of the provided IR code, showing the data relationships and generating the corresponding DOT file.
