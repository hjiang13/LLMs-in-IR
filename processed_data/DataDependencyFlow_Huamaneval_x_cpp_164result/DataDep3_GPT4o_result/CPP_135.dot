### Analysis of the Input IR Code

In the provided IR code, we will analyze the variables and their data dependency relationships. 

#### Identified Variables:
1. `%0`: Parameter of the function `@_Z11can_arrangeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`
2. `%2`, `%3`, `%4`, `%5`, `%6`, `%7`, `%8`, `%9`: Intermediate variables involved in pointer arithmetic and comparisons.
3. `%10`: A basic block label.
4. `%11`, `%12`, `%13`, `%14`, `%15`: Variables involved in bitwise and arithmetic operations.
6. `%16`: A basic block label.
7. `%17`: Intermediate variable.
8. `%18`: A basic block label.
9. `%19`, `%20`, `%21`, `%22`, `%24`, `%25`, `%26`, `%27`, `%28`, `%29`, `%30`, `%31`, `%32`, `%33`, `%34`, `%35`: Variables involved in various arithmetic and comparison operations.
10. `%36`: A basic block label.
11. `%38`: A basic block label.
12. `%39`, `%40`, `%41`, `%42`, `%43`, `%44`, `%45`, `%46`, `%47`, `%48`, `%49`, `%50`, `%51`, `%52`, `%53`, `%54`, `%55`, `%56`, `%57`, `%58`, `%59`, `%60`, `%61`, `%62`, `%63`, `%64`, `%65`, `%66`, `%67`, `%68`, `%69`, `%70`, `%71`: More intermediate variables in the control flow.

#### Dependency Analysis:
- The variables within the same function have dependencies due to the use of `phi` nodes and `load` instructions which indicate that their values are influenced by preceding calculations.
- For example:
  - `%19` depends on either `undef` or `%68` based on control flow.
  - `%20` depends on either `0` or `%69`.
  - `%21` depends on either `-1` or `%68`.
- The variables `%24`, `%25`, `%26` depend on the flow from previous computations in the same function, indicating a clear data dependency.
  
Given that all identified variables are interdependent within the function, we will establish that they are data-dependent.

### Resulting Dependency Statements
- Between different blocks of the same function, there are dependencies established through control flow.
- There are no variables that are independent across function calls since this IR code is a single function.

### DOT File Representation
Based on the analysis, we can represent the dependencies in a DOT file format.

```dot
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    "function:@_Z11can_arrangeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE:%0" [label="Parameter %0"];
    "function:@_Z11can_arrangeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE:%2" [label="Variable %2"];
    "function:@_Z11can_arrangeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE:%3" [label="Variable %3"];
    "function:@_Z11can_arrangeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE:%4" [label="Variable %4"];
    "function:@_Z11can_arrangeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE:%5" [label="Variable %5"];
    "function:@_Z11can_arrangeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE:%6" [label="Variable %6"];
    "function:@_Z11can_arrangeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE:%7" [label="Variable %7"];
    "function:@_Z11can_arrangeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE:%8" [label="Variable %8"];
    "function:@_Z11can_arrangeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE:%9" [label="Variable %9"];
    "function:@_Z11can_arrangeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE:%19" [label="Variable %19"];
    "function:@_Z11can_arrangeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE:%20" [label="Variable %20"];
    "function:@_Z11can_arrangeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE:%21" [label="Variable %21"];
    "function:@_Z11can_arrangeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE:%24" [label="Variable %24"];
    "function:@_Z11can_arrangeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE:%25" [label="Variable %25"];
    "function:@_Z11can_arrangeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE:%26" [label="Variable %26"];
    "function:@_Z11can_arrangeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE:%36" [label="Basic Block %36"];
    "function:@_Z11can_arrangeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE:%38" [label="Basic Block %38"];
}
```

### Summary
- The variables within the function are interdependent.
- The DOT representation illustrates these relationships.
- Therefore, the output indicates that all variables are indeed data-dependent on one another within the analyzed function.
