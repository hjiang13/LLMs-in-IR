To analyze the given Intermediate Representation (IR) code for data dependency among variables, we will first identify the variables and functions, analyze their dependencies, and then generate a DOT file to represent these relationships.

### Identifying Variables and Functions
From the IR code provided, we can identify the following functions and their respective variables:

1. **Function `@_Z13specialFilterSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`**:
   - Local variables:
     - `%2` (alloca for `basic_string`)
     - `%3`, `%4` (getelementptr for vectors)
     - `%5`, `%6`, `%7`, `%8`, `%9`, `%10`, `%11`, `%12`, `%14`, ..., `%53` (various operations)

2. **Function `@__gnu_cxx12__to_xstringINSt7__cxx1112basic_string`**:
   - Local variables:
     - `%0` (parameter)
     - `%5`, `%6`, `%7`, `%8`, `%9`, ..., `%32` (various operations)
  
### Analyzing Dependencies
We will analyze the dependencies based on the following observations:

- **Local Variables within Functions**: Variables created within a function (like `%2`, `%3`, etc.) are not data-dependent on other variables in different functions. Thus, dependencies are scoped locally.

- **Cross-Function Dependencies**: There are no cross-function dependencies observed from the given IR code. Each function operates independently on its local variables, with no shared states or variables between them.

### Dependency Results
Given the analysis, we conclude:
- There are no data dependencies between the variables across the identified functions in the provided IR code.

### DOT File Representation
Based on the above analysis, here is the DOT file representation:

```dot
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    "specialFilter:%2" [label="Variable %2 in @_Z13specialFilterSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];
    "specialFilter:%3" [label="Variable %3 in @_Z13specialFilterSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];
    "specialFilter:%4" [label="Variable %4 in @_Z13specialFilterSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];
    "specialFilter:%5" [label="Variable %5 in @_Z13specialFilterSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];
    "specialFilter:%6" [label="Variable %6 in @_Z13specialFilterSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];
    "specialFilter:%7" [label="Variable %7 in @_Z13specialFilterSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];
    "specialFilter:%8" [label="Variable %8 in @_Z13specialFilterSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];
    "specialFilter:%9" [label="Variable %9 in @_Z13specialFilterSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];
    "specialFilter:%10" [label="Variable %10 in @_Z13specialFilterSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];
    "specialFilter:%11" [label="Variable %11 in @_Z13specialFilterSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];
    "specialFilter:%12" [label="Variable %12 in @_Z13specialFilterSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];
    // ... Continue for remaining variables in specialFilter function

    "to_xstring:%0" [label="Variable %0 in @__gnu_cxx12__to_xstringINSt7__cxx1112basic_string"];
    "to_xstring:%5" [label="Variable %5 in @__gnu_cxx12__to_xstringINSt7__cxx1112basic_string"];
    "to_xstring:%6" [label="Variable %6 in @__gnu_cxx12__to_xstringINSt7__cxx1112basic_string"];
    "to_xstring:%7" [label="Variable %7 in @__gnu_cxx12__to_xstringINSt7__cxx1112basic_string"];
    // ... Continue for remaining variables in to_xstring function
}
```

### Summary
- **Data Dependency Label**: `no`
- **Explanation**: There are no data dependencies between variables across the functions in the provided IR code. Each function operates independently without sharing or affecting each other's state.
