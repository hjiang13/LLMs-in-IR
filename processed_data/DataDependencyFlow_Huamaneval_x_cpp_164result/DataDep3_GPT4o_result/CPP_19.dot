To analyze the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will identify the variables, functions, and their dependencies. The goal is to determine the data dependency relationships between the variables across functions and represent these relationships in a DOT file format.

### Analysis of the IR Code

1. **Identify Variables and Functions**:
   - Functions identified:
     - `@_Z12sort_numbersNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`
     - `@_ZNSt3mapINSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEEiSt4lessIS5_ESaISt4pairIKS5_iEEEC2ESt16initializer_listISA_ERKS7_RKSB_`
     - Other nested functions related to `std::map` and `std::__cxx11::basic_string`.
   - Variables identified include:
     - `%"class.std::__cxx11::basic_string"`
     - `%"class.std::map"`
     - Local variables within `@_Z12sort_numbers...` function (e.g., `%5`, `%6`, etc.).

2. **Data Dependency Analysis**:
   - Dependencies are identified based on the use of values from one variable to affect another.
   - In `@_Z12sort_numbers...`, local variables (like `%5`, `%6`, etc.) are used, and their values are set and later read. However, these do not cross into other functions.
   - The functions related to `std::map` and `std::__cxx11::basic_string` also have their own local state which does not influence the state of the variables in the main function directly.
   - Overall, local variables within one function do not influence or depend on the variables of another function in the given IR code.

### Summary of Dependencies
- Since the variables across different functions do not influence each other, the relationships can be summarized as:
    - **Output**: The variables are not data-dependent across functions.

### Output DOT File Representation
Based on the analysis, here is the DOT file representation:

```dot
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    "sort_numbers:local_var_1" [label="Local Variable 1 in sort_numbers"];
    "sort_numbers:local_var_2" [label="Local Variable 2 in sort_numbers"];
    "map_function:map_var_1" [label="Map Variable 1"];
    "map_function:map_var_2" [label="Map Variable 2"];
    // Add other local variables from other functions as needed
}
```

### Conclusion
- There are no data dependencies between the variables across the identified functions.
- The output label for the dependency analysis is `no`.
