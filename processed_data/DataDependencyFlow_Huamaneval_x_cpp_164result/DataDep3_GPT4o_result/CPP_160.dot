### Analysis of Dependencies

In the provided IR code, we need to analyze the dependencies between various variables across functions. The relevant variables are primarily pointers and local variables used in the function `@do_algebra`. 

Here are the key observations for the variables:

1. **Variables in `@do_algebra` function**:
   - `%5`, `%6`: Both are loaded from pointers that come from `%3` and `%4`, which are derived from the input vectors.
   - `%12`, `%13`: Loaded from `%10` and `%11`, which are also derived from the input vectors.
   - `%9`, `%10`, `%11`, `%12`, `%13`: These variables are used to perform comparisons and store results.

2. **Data Dependencies**:
   - The loading of variables:
     - `%5` and `%6` are dependent on `%3` and `%4` respectively.
     - `%12` and `%13` are dependent on `%10` and `%11` respectively.
   - The various comparison operators (`icmp`) indicate dependencies among the local variables as they influence the flow of control (branches).

3. **Inter-function Dependencies**:
   - Since the only function is `@do_algebra`, we are concerned only with dependencies within this function. There are no inter-function dependencies to analyze as no other functions directly interact with the variables.

### Conclusion

- The variables within the same function exhibit data dependencies due to the load and store operations and the comparisons made between these variables.
- Therefore, we can conclude that there are data dependencies among the variables in the `@do_algebra` function.

### DOT File Representation

The DOT file will represent these dependencies as follows:

```dot
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    "do_algebra:%5" [label="Variable %5 in do_algebra"];
    "do_algebra:%6" [label="Variable %6 in do_algebra"];
    "do_algebra:%12" [label="Variable %12 in do_algebra"];
    "do_algebra:%13" [label="Variable %13 in do_algebra"];
    "do_algebra:%9" [label="Variable %9 in do_algebra"];
    "do_algebra:%10" [label="Variable %10 in do_algebra"];
    "do_algebra:%11" [label="Variable %11 in do_algebra"];

    "do_algebra:%5" -> "do_algebra:%3";
    "do_algebra:%6" -> "do_algebra:%4";
    "do_algebra:%12" -> "do_algebra:%10";
    "do_algebra:%13" -> "do_algebra:%11";
}
```

### Summary

- The variables are data-dependent due to the load/store and comparison operations.
- The DOT representation illustrates the dependencies clearly within the `@do_algebra` function. 

The overall conclusion is that the variables within the `@do_algebra` function exhibit dependencies, labeled as 'yes' in terms of data dependency.
