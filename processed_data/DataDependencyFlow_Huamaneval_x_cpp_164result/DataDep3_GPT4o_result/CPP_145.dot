### Analysis of the Provided IR Code

After analyzing the given Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can identify variables and their dependencies. The IR code provided involves multiple calls to functions and contains several variables, particularly pointers and data structures related to vectors and strings.

#### Identified Variables and Their Dependencies

1. **Variables**:
   - `%0`, `%1`: Pointers to `%"class.std::vector"`.
   - `%3`: Local variable of type `%"class.std::__cxx11::basic_string"`.
   - `%4`, `%5`: Pointers and elements within the vector.
   - `%6`: Pointer to an `i8` type.
   - `%11`, `%12`: Loaded pointers from the vector structure.
   - `%19`, `%20`, `%21`: Various indices and pointers used for accessing elements in the vector.

2. **Function Calls**:
   - The function `@_Z15order_by_pointsSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` manipulates vector types and calls other functions like `@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8`, `@llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8`, and `@llvm.abs.i32`.

#### Data Dependency Analysis

- **Within Functions**: The variables within the function `@_Z15order_by_pointsSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` exhibit dependencies since they load and store values from the same vector pointers. For example, the use of `%11` and `%12` in an `icmp` operation indicates a direct dependency as they are loaded from the same vector.
  
- **Across Functions**: The analysis of dependencies across the functions is complicated due to the absence of direct interactions between the variables of `@_Z15order_by_pointsSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` and any other function within the provided code. Thus, we can conclude that there are no inter-function dependencies.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, we can summarize the dependency relationships:

- **Intra-function Dependencies**: Yes, various variables inside `@_Z15order_by_pointsSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` are dependent on each other.
- **Inter-function Dependencies**: No, there are no dependencies between the variables across different functions.

    "order_by_points:%21" [label="Variable %21 in order_by_points"];
    
    // Dependencies within the function
    "order_by_points:%11" -> "order_by_points:%12" [label="load from vector"];
    "order_by_points:%19" -> "order_by_points:%20" [label="index access"];
}
```

### Summary

- **Data Dependency**: Yes (for intra-function), No (for inter-function).
- **DOT Representation**: Provided above illustrates the dependencies within the function `@_Z15order_by_pointsSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`.
