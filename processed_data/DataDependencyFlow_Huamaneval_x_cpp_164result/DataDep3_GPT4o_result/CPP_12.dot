### Analysis of the Provided IR Code

1. **Identify Variables and Functions**:
   - The function defined is `@_Z7longestSt6vectorINSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEESaIS5_EE`.
   - The variables of interest include:
     - `%0`, `%1`, `%3`, `%4`, `%5`, `%6`, `%7`, `%8`, `%9`, `%10`, `%11`, `%13`, `%14`, `%15`, `%16`, `%17`, `%21`, `%23`, `%24`, `%26`, `%27`, `%28`, `%29`, `%32`, `%33`, `%34`, `%35`, `%36`, `%37`, `%38`, `%39`, `%40`, `%42`.

2. **Analyze Dependencies**:
   - The main variables involved in data dependencies are:
     - `%0`: Pointer to a `basic_string`
     - `%1`: Pointer to a `vector`
     - `%3`, `%4`: Pointers related to `basic_string` and memory operations.
     - `%13`, `%14`: These phi nodes depend on previous values from `%9`, `%10`, `%33`, and `%34`.
   - The analysis indicates that there are data dependencies between:
     - `%3` and `%4` as they are involved in a `load` and `store` operation.
     - The phi nodes `%13`, `%14`, `%15`, and `%16` depend on values coming from earlier computations and branches.
   - The function also includes an external invocation to `_ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE9_M_assignERKS4_`, which suggests that `%0` and `%21` are dependent on each other in the context of calling this function.

3. **Determine Relationships**:
   - Based on the operations, it can be concluded that:
     - `%0`, `%1`, `%3`, `%4`, `%13`, and `%14` have direct dependencies.
     - The variable `%5` is updated based on the store operation from `%16`, which ties back to the control flow via the previous variables.

### Conclusion

Some variables have clear data dependencies, while others are independent.
