The provided IR code defines a function that calculates the area of a triangle given its three sides. Let's analyze the dependencies among the variables in the function.

### Analyzing Dependencies

1. **Variables Identified**:
   - `%0`, `%1`, `%2`: Inputs to the function (three sides of the triangle).
   - `%4`: Result of `fadd float %0, %1`.
   - `%5`: Result of `fcmp ugt float %4, %2`.
   - `%6`: Result of `fadd float %0, %2`.
   - `%7`: Result of `fcmp ugt float %6, %1`.
   - `%8`: Result of `and i1 %5, %7`.
   - `%9`: Result of `fadd float %1, %2`.
   - `%10`: Result of `fcmp ugt float %9, %0`.
   - `%11`: Result of `select i1 %8, i1 %10, i1 false`.
   - `%13`, `%14`, `%15`, `%16`, `%17`, `%18`: Intermediate calculations in the block labeled `12`.
   - `%19`, `%20`, `%21`, `%22`, `%23`: Further calculations leading to the final return value.

2. **Data Dependency Relationships**:
   - The operations within block `12` depend on the values calculated in block `3` (the initial conditions and comparisons).
   - The final return value `%25` depends on the value of `%23`, which is calculated based on the previous operations.
   - There are no variables from this function that are influenced by or influence variables from other functions (as there is only one function defined here).

### Conclusion
Given that all variables within the function are dependent on previous calculations and do not share data with any external functions, we can conclude that there are dependencies among the variables within the function.

### DOT File Representation
Based on the analysis, here is the DOT representation of the data dependencies:
