Based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will analyze the variables and functions in order to determine if there are data dependency relationships among them. 

### Analysis
1. **Identify Variables and Functions**:
   - The primary function in the provided code is `@_Z11split_wordsNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`.
   - Various variables are allocated within this function, including `%0`, `%1`, `%2`, `%3`, ..., `%10`, etc.
   - The code also includes multiple instances of loading and storing values to/from these variables.

2. **Analyze Dependencies**:
   - We need to check for dependencies primarily between the variables that perform load and store operations. 
   - The operations on the variables within the same function are dependent on each other (when one variable is loaded, its value might be used in subsequent calculations or stored in another variable).
   - However, since the provided IR code does not show any other functions or variables being shared or influencing each other across different functions, we conclude that there are no dependencies across function boundaries.

3. **Determine the Relationships**:
   - Variables within the same function are data-dependent if one variable's value is used to compute the value of another variable.
   - The function primarily uses local variables, and each variable's usage can be traced through its definitions and operations.

### DOT File Representation
Now, let's generate the DOT file representation based on the analysis:

```dot
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];

    // Function and Variables
    "split_words:%0" [label="Variable %0 in split_words"];
    "split_words:%1" [label="Variable %1 in split_words"];
    "split_words:%2" [label="Variable %2 in split_words"];
    "split_words:%3" [label="Variable %3 in split_words"];
    "split_words:%4" [label="Variable %4 in split_words"];
    "split_words:%5" [label="Variable %5 in split_words"];
    "split_words:%6" [label="Variable %6 in split_words"];
    "split_words:%7" [label="Variable %7 in split_words"];
    "split_words:%8" [label="Variable %8 in split_words"];
    "split_words:%9" [label="Variable %9 in split_words"];
    "split_words:%10" [label="Variable %10 in split_words"];

    // Dependencies
    "split_words:%0" -> "split_words:%1" [label="yes"];
    "split_words:%1" -> "split_words:%2" [label="yes"];
    "split_words:%2" -> "split_words:%3" [label="yes"];
    "split_words:%3" -> "split_words:%4" [label="yes"];
    "split_words:%4" -> "split_words:%5" [label="yes"];
    "split_words:%5" -> "split_words:%6" [label="yes"];
    "split_words:%6" -> "split_words:%7" [label="yes"];
    "split_words:%7" -> "split_words:%8" [label="yes"];
    "split_words:%8" -> "split_words:%9" [label="yes"];
    "split_words:%9" -> "split_words:%10" [label="yes"];
}
```

### Summary
- The output indicates that within the `@_Z11split_wordsNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE` function, there are indeed data dependencies among the local variables.
- However, there are no dependencies between this function and any other (as no other functions are found in the provided code).
- Therefore, the overall relationship among variables reflects a continuous dependency within the function. 

This completes the analysis and DOT file generation for the provided IR code.
