To analyze the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code and determine data dependency relationships, we will identify variables, functions, and their interactions.

### Analysis of the IR Code

1. **Identify Variables and Functions**:
   - Function: `@_Z11sum_squaresSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`
   - Variables within the function:
     - `%0` (input parameter)
     - `%2`, `%3`, `%4`, `%5`, `%6`, `%7`, `%8`, `%9`, `%11`, `%12`, `%14`, `%16`, `%17`, `%18`, `%19`, `%20`, `%22`, `%23`, `%24`, `%26`, `%27`, `%28`, `%29`, `%31`, `%32`, `%34`, `%35`, `%36`, `%37`

2. **Analyze Dependencies**:
   - **Direct Dependencies**:
     - `%3` is loaded from `%2` which is dependent on `%0`.
     - `%5` is loaded from `%4`, which is also dependent on `%0`.
     - The operations on `%11`, `%12`, `%14` depend on previous computations, including `%34`, `%35`, etc.
   - **Control Dependencies**:
     - The branch instructions (`br`) determine which code path to follow, impacting how the values of variables are computed.
   - **Variable Use**:
     - Variables like `%34`, `%35`, and `%36` are influenced by earlier computations from branches.

3. **Conclusion on Dependencies**:
   - The function has internal dependencies among its variables due to the operations that rely on the results of prior computations.
   - However, there are **no dependencies** between the function variables and any external variables or functions.

### Output

#### Dependency Relationship
- **Overall Dependency**: The variables within the function are data-dependent on each other.
