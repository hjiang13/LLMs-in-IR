To analyze the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code for data dependencies and generate a DOT file representing these dependencies, we will first identify the variables and their relationships, and then determine if they are dependent.

### Analyzing the IR Code

1. **Identify Variables**:
   - The variables identified in the IR code include:
     - `%0`: Input parameter of the function.
     - `%2`, `%3`, `%4`, `%6`, `%7`, `%8`, `%9`, `%11`, `%12`, `%13`, `%14`, `%15`, `%16`, `%17`, `%19`, `%20`, `%21`, `%22`, `%23`, `%25`, `%26`, `%27`, `%28`, `%29`, `%30`, `%31`, `%32`, `%33`, `%34`, `%35`, `%36`, `%37`, `%38`, `%39`, `%40`, `%43`, `%44`, `%45`, `%46`, `%47`, `%48`, `%49`, `%50`, `%51`, `%52`, `%53`, `%54`, `%55`, `%56`, `%57`, `%60`, `%61`, `%62`, `%63`.

2. **Analyze Dependencies**:
   - The analysis focuses on whether the output of one variable is used as input to another variable. For instance:
     - `%3` is loaded from `%2` which is derived from `%0`. This indicates a dependency.
     - `%8` depends on `%3`, since `%3` is used in the `and` operation.
     - `%22` depends on `%16` and the result of an operation involving `%21`.
     - `%25` is dependent on both `%13`, `%22` and the result of the previous branch logic.
     - The phi nodes (e.g., `%14`, `%15`, `%25`, `%27`, etc.) demonstrate conditional dependencies based on control flow.

3. **Determining Data Dependencies**:
   - Based on the analysis, there are numerous dependencies among the variables. For instance, `%3` (derived from `%0`) directly influences `%8`, and the output of `%25` is influenced by multiple prior computations including `%22`, `%16`, and `%13`.

### DOT File Generation

The DOT file will represent the dependencies identified in the analysis:

```dot
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    "function:@_Z8is_bored" [label="Function @_Z8is_bored"];
    "input:%0" [label="Input %0"];
    "load:%3" [label="Variable %3"];
    "load:%8" [label="Variable %8"];
    "load:%16" [label="Variable %16"];
    "load:%22" [label="Variable %22"];
    "phi:%25" [label="Variable %25"];
    "phi:%14" [label="Variable %14"];
    "phi:%15" [label="Variable %15"];
    
    "input:%0" -> "load:%3" [label="yes"];
    "load:%3" -> "load:%8" [label="yes"];
    "load:%16" -> "phi:%25" [label="yes"];
    "load:%22" -> "phi:%25" [label="yes"];
    "phi:%14" -> "phi:%25" [label="yes"];
    "phi:%15" -> "phi:%25" [label="yes"];
}
```

### Conclusion

In summary, the analysis identifies multiple data dependencies between the variables in the provided IR code. The DOT file reflects these dependencies, indicating relationships that can influence the program's execution flow.
