To analyze the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will identify the variables, examine their dependencies, and determine if they are data-dependent. We will then generate a DOT file representing these dependencies.

### Step 1: Identify Variables

The IR code contains the following variables:

1. **Function `@hex_key`**:
    - `%0`: input argument of type `basic_string`
    - `%2`: local variable (alloca) of type `basic_string`
    - `%3`: pointer to the allocated `basic_string`
    - `%4`: pointer to `union.anon`
    - `%5`: pointer to `union.anon` (casted)
    - `%6`: pointer to `i8`
    - `%7`: pointer to `i64`
    - `%8`: pointer to `i8`
    - `%9`: pointer to `i8`
    - `%10`: load from `%9` (of type `i64`)
    - `%11`: result of an `icmp` comparison
    - `%12`, `%13`, ... up to `%51`: various other local computed variables, primarily used for control flow and comparisons.

### Step 2: Analyze Dependencies

#### Within Function `@hex_key`

- `%0` (input) influences the computation of `%10`, which is loaded from `%9` (the address derived from `%0`).
- `%2` and `%4` are used to store values, but they do not depend on `%0`.
- The `%27` and `%28` variables are defined using the `phi` instruction, indicating they can take values from multiple predecessors, which introduces dependencies among them.
- The dependencies among local variables occur due to the chain of loads, stores, and computations that depend on previous values.

#### Across Functions

Since there is no other function defined in the provided IR code snippet, we only have one function's context to consider. Therefore, all dependencies will be within `@hex_key`.

### Step 3: Create DOT File Representation

Based on the analysis, we can summarize the dependencies. The variables within the same function interact with each other, indicating a data dependency.

#### DOT File Representation

```dot
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    "hex_key:%0" [label="Variable %0 in hex_key"];
    "hex_key:%2" [label="Variable %2 in hex_key"];
    "hex_key:%3" [label="Variable %3 in hex_key"];
    "hex_key:%4" [label="Variable %4 in hex_key"];
    "hex_key:%5" [label="Variable %5 in hex_key"];
    "hex_key:%6" [label="Variable %6 in hex_key"];
    "hex_key:%7" [label="Variable %7 in hex_key"];
    "hex_key:%8" [label="Variable %8 in hex_key"];
    "hex_key:%9" [label="Variable %9 in hex_key"];
    "hex_key:%10" [label="Variable %10 in hex_key"];
    "hex_key:%11" [label="Variable %11 in hex_key"];
    "hex_key:%27" [label="Variable %27 in hex_key"];
    "hex_key:%28" [label="Variable %28 in hex_key"];
    "hex_key:%44" [label="Variable %44 in hex_key"];
    "hex_key:%51" [label="Variable %51 in hex_key"];

    // Data dependencies
    "hex_key:%0" -> "hex_key:%10" [label="depends on"];
    "hex_key:%11" -> "hex_key:%27" [label="depends on"];
    "hex_key:%27" -> "hex_key:%44" [label="depends on"];
    "hex_key:%44" -> "hex_key:%51" [label="depends on"];
}
```

### Conclusion

- **Data Dependency Analysis Result**: Yes, there are data dependencies among the variables in the function `@hex_key`.
- **DOT File**: The provided DOT representation illustrates the dependencies among the variables.
