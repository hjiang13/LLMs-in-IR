To analyze the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code for data dependencies, we need to identify the variables and functions, analyze their dependencies, and generate a DOT file representation.

### Analysis of Dependencies

1. **Variables and Functions Identification**:
   - **Functions**: There are several functions defined, including `@_Z10sort_arraySt6vectorIiSaIiEE`, `@_ZSt16__introsort_loopIN9__gnu_cxx17__normal_iteratorIPiSt6vectorIiSaIiEEEElNS0_5__ops15_Iter_less_iterEEvT_S9_T0_T1_`, and `@_ZSt22__final_insertion_sortIN9__gnu_cxx17__normal_iteratorIPiSt6vectorIiSaIiEEEENS0_5__ops15_Iter_less_iterEEvT_S9_T0_`.
   - **Variables**: There are many variables used in these functions, e.g., `%0`, `%1`, `%2`, `%3`, etc.

2. **Dependency Analysis**:
   - The analysis focuses on the operations on these variables, particularly `load`, `store`, and arithmetic operations.
   - For example:
     - In the function `@_Z10sort_arraySt6vectorIiSaIiEE`, the variable `%4` (loaded value) is used to compute `%7`, which is then used in further calculations.
     - The variables `%6` and `%4` interact through various `load` operations and influence the flow of the program.

3. **Data Dependency Determination**:
   - The variables within the same function often exhibit dependencies due to the flow of data (e.g., one variable being computed based on the value of another).
   - However, variables across different functions are generally independent unless explicitly passed between them.

### Dependency Relationships
- Based on the structure of the IR code, we can determine that:
  - Variables in the same function are typically data-dependent (resulting in "yes").
  - Variables across different functions are not data-dependent (resulting in "no").

### DOT File Generation
The output DOT file represents the variables as nodes and their dependencies as directed edges.

```dot
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    
    "sort_array:%0" [label="Variable %0 in sort_array"];
    "sort_array:%1" [label="Variable %1 in sort_array"];
    "sort_array:%4" [label="Variable %4 in sort_array"];
    
    "introsort_loop:%0" [label="Variable %0 in introsort_loop"];
    "introsort_loop:%1" [label="Variable %1 in introsort_loop"];
    "introsort_loop:%2" [label="Variable %2 in introsort_loop"];
    
    "final_insertion_sort:%0" [label="Variable %0 in final_insertion_sort"];
    "final_insertion_sort:%1" [label="Variable %1 in final_insertion_sort"];
    
    // Dependencies within sort_array
    "sort_array:%0" -> "sort_array:%4";
    "sort_array:%1" -> "sort_array:%4";
    
    // Dependencies within introsort_loop
    "introsort_loop:%0" -> "introsort_loop:%2";
    "introsort_loop:%1" -> "introsort_loop:%2";
    
    // Dependencies within final_insertion_sort
    "final_insertion_sort:%0" -> "final_insertion_sort:%1";
}
```

### Summary
- The relationship between variables within the same function is data-dependent.
- Variables across different functions do not exhibit data dependencies.
- The generated DOT file captures these relationships for visualization.
