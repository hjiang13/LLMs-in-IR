### Analysis of the Given Intermediate Representation (IR) Code

The provided IR code defines a function that calculates Fibonacci numbers. We will analyze the dependencies among the variables used within this function.

#### Identified Variables

From the given IR code, we can identify the following variables:

- **Function:** `_Z4fib4i(i32 %0)` (Fibonacci function)
- **Allocations:**
  - `%2`: Allocated array of size 100 (i32)
- **Temporary Variables:**
  - `%3`, `%4`, `%5`, `%7`, `%8`, `%9`, `%11`, `%12`, `%13`, `%15`, `%16`, `%18`, `%19`, `%20`, `%21`, `%22`, `%24`, `%25`, `%26`, `%28`, `%29`, `%30`, `%31`, `%32`, `%33`, `%35`, `%36`, `%37`, `%39`, `%40`, `%41`, `%42`, `%43`, `%44`, `%45`, `%46`, `%48`, `%49`, `%50`, `%51`, `%52`, `%53`, `%54`, `%55`, `%56`, `%57`, `%58`, `%59`, `%60`, `%61`, `%62`, `%63`, `%64`, `%65`, `%66`, `%67`.

#### Dependency Analysis

1. **Variables `%19`, `%21`, `%30`, `%32`, `%33`**: These variables depend on values that are stored in the allocated array `%2` (specifically, the indices of the array depend on previous calculations). They accumulate results based on previously computed Fibonacci values.

2. **Variables `%40`, `%42`, `%50`, `%52`, `%63`**: Similar to the previous set, these variables also depend on values stored in the same array and thus have a data dependency relationship with the variables that they compute from.

3. **Variables `%18`, `%39`, `%43`, `%54`, `%65`**: These variables are used in the computations that lead to the results stored in the array. Their values depend on the previous iterations and the results computed in the loop.

4. **Variables across functions**: There are no other functions or variables present in the provided IR code snippet, so we do not have any inter-function dependencies to consider here.

### Dependency Summary

- The variables mentioned above have a clear data dependency relationship with each other, based on how they are computed and how they interact with the allocated array.

### DOT File Representation

The relationships can be represented in a DOT format for visualization:

```dot
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    "fib_function:%2" [label="Array %2 used for Fibonacci values"];
    "fib_function:%19" [label="Variable %19 calculated from %18"];
    "fib_function:%21" [label="Variable %21 calculated from %19"];
    "fib_function:%30" [label="Variable %30 calculated from %28, %19"];
    "fib_function:%32" [label="Variable %32 calculated from %30, %21, %29"];
    "fib_function:%33" [label="Variable %33 stored in %2"];
    
    "fib_function:%40" [label="Variable %40 calculated from %39"];
    "fib_function:%42" [label="Variable %42 calculated from %40"];
    "fib_function:%50" [label="Variable %50 calculated from %48"];
    "fib_function:%52" [label="Variable %52 calculated from %50, %42"];
    "fib_function:%63" [label="Variable %63 calculated from %62, %60"];
    
    // Edges representing dependencies
    "fib_function:%2" -> "fib_function:%19";
    "fib_function:%19" -> "fib_function:%21";
    "fib_function:%19" -> "fib_function:%30";
    "fib_function:%30" -> "fib_function:%32";
    "fib_function:%21" -> "fib_function:%32";
    "fib_function:%18" -> "fib_function:%33";
    
    "fib_function:%39" -> "fib_function:%40";
    "fib_function:%40" -> "fib_function:%42";
    "fib_function:%48" -> "fib_function:%50";
    "fib_function:%50" -> "fib_function:%52";
    "fib_function:%62" -> "fib_function:%63";
}
```

### Conclusion

- **Data Dependency**: There are multiple data dependencies within the variables of the provided IR code.
- **DOT Representation**: The DOT file captures the relationships, allowing for visualization of the dependencies in the computation of Fibonacci numbers.
