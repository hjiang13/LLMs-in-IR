To analyze the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code for data dependencies, we need to identify the variables, their operations, and their relationships. Following that, we'll generate a DOT file to represent these dependencies.

### Analysis

1. **Identify Variables and Functions**:
   - The IR code consists of multiple variables across various functions. Key variables include:
     - `%0`, `%1`, `%2`, ..., `%220` (used within the function)
     - Variables like `@llvm.memset.p0i8.i64`, `@__gxx_personality_v0`, etc., are function declarations and not directly involved in the data flow.
   
2. **Analyze Dependencies**:
   - We'll look for load, store, and arithmetic operations to determine dependencies.
   - Relationships can be established based on:
     - A variable being loaded from another variable (load/store relationship).
     - Variables being read or written in the same or different functions.

3. **Dependency Relationships**:
   - The provided IR code has several variables that are involved in conditional branches and arithmetic operations.
   - For example:
     - `%12 = load i32*, i32** %4` and `%13 = load i32*, i32** %5` seem to have a relationship based on their subsequent comparison and branch decisions.
     - Multiple variables are used in the same function and influence each other's values.
   - However, variables across different functions (like between `@_Z6commonSt6vectorIiSaIiEES1_` and any other function) do not create dependencies since they operate in isolation.

### Conclusion
Given the complexity and the nature of the code, we can conclude:

- Variables within the same function may have dependencies.
- Variables across different functions do not have dependencies.

### Output DOT File Representation
The DOT file will represent the relationships among the identified variables. Here is a simple representation based on the analysis:

```dot
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    "common_function:%0" [label="Variable %0 in common_function"];
    "common_function:%1" [label="Variable %1 in common_function"];
    "common_function:%2" [label="Variable %2 in common_function"];
    "common_function:%12" [label="Variable %12 in common_function"];
    "common_function:%13" [label="Variable %13 in common_function"];
    "common_function:%14" [label="Variable %14 in common_function"];
    "common_function:%14" -> "common_function:%12" [label="load"];
    "common_function:%12" -> "common_function:%13" [label="load"];
    "common_function:%13" -> "common_function:%14" [label="store"];
    // More variable relationships can be added based on the analysis
}
```

### Final Output
Label: **unknown**

Explanation: The variable relationships within the function show that while there are dependencies between variables, the lack of information about interactions with other functions leads to an uncertain overall dependency state.

The final output reflects the established relationships within the function while acknowledging the complexity of inter-function dependencies.
