To analyze the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code and determine the data dependencies, we will follow these steps:

1. Identify the variables and their usage.
2. Analyze the data dependencies among these variables.
3. Generate a DOT file that represents these dependencies.

### Step 1: Identify Variables and Functions

From the provided IR code, we can identify the following variables and functions:

**Function**: `@_Z9is_sortedSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`
- **Variables**:
  - `%0`: Argument of the function (pointer to a vector)
  - `%2`: GEP result (pointer)
  - `%3`: Loaded pointer
  - `%4`: GEP result (pointer)
  - `%5`: Loaded pointer
  - `%6`: Pointer to integer
  - `%7`: Pointer to integer
  - `%8`: Subtraction result
  - `%9`: Arithmetic right shift result
  - `%10`: Comparison result
  - `%12`: Loaded integer
  - `%14`: Phi variable (depends on control flow)
  - `%15`: Phi variable (depends on control flow)
  - `%16`: GEP result (pointer)
  - `%17`: Loaded integer
  - `%18`, `%20`, `%21`, `%22`, `%24`, `%25`, `%26`, `%27`, `%28`, `%30`, `%31`, `%33`: Various computed and control flow values.

### Step 2: Analyze Dependencies

In this function, we have the following dependencies:

- `%3` is loaded from `%2`, which is derived from `%0`. Therefore, `%3` depends on `%0`.
- `%5` is loaded from `%4`, which is derived from `%0`. Therefore, `%5` also depends on `%0`.
- `%12` is loaded from `%5`, indicating a dependency of `%12` on `%5`.
- `%14` is a phi node that takes input from `%12` and `%17`, thus creating dependencies.
- `%15` is another phi node that takes input from `%11` and `%30`, which also depends on control flow.
- `%17` is loaded from `%16`, and `%16` is a GEP result that depends on `%15`.
- The comparisons and arithmetic operations involving these variables also create further dependencies.

No inter-function dependencies are present since there’s only one function in the provided IR code.

### Summary of Dependencies

1. `%3` depends on `%0` (yes)
2. `%5` depends on `%0` (yes)
3. `%12` depends on `%5` (yes)
4. `%14` depends on `%12` and `%17` (yes)
5. `%15` depends on `%11` and `%30` (unknown due to control flow)
6. `%17` depends on `%16` (yes)
7. `%16` depends on `%15` (yes)

Given this analysis, we conclude that there are many dependencies among the variables within the same function.

### Step 3: Generate DOT File

Here’s the DOT file representation based on the dependencies identified:

```dot
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    "is_sorted:%0" [label="Variable %0 in is_sorted"];
    "is_sorted:%2" [label="Variable %2 in is_sorted"];
    "is_sorted:%3" [label="Variable %3 in is_sorted"];
    "is_sorted:%4" [label="Variable %4 in is_sorted"];
    "is_sorted:%5" [label="Variable %5 in is_sorted"];
    "is_sorted:%12" [label="Variable %12 in is_sorted"];
    "is_sorted:%14" [label="Variable %14 in is_sorted"];
    "is_sorted:%15" [label="Variable %15 in is_sorted"];
    "is_sorted:%16" [label="Variable %16 in is_sorted"];
    "is_sorted:%17" [label="Variable %17 in is_sorted"];
    
    "is_sorted:%0" -> "is_sorted:%3" [label="yes"];
    "is_sorted:%0" -> "is_sorted:%5" [label="yes"];
    "is_sorted:%5" -> "is_sorted:%12" [label="yes"];
    "is_sorted:%12" -> "is_sorted:%14" [label="yes"];
    "is_sorted:%15" -> "is_sorted:%16" [label="yes"];
    "is_sorted:%15" -> "is_sorted:%17" [label="yes"];
}
```

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, we have established that there are data dependencies among the variables within the `@_Z9is_sortedSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` function. The provided DOT file visualizes these relationships clearly.
