### Analysis of the Provided IR Code

**Identifying Variables and Functions:**
- The IR code defines the function `@_Z5pluckSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`.
- The relevant variables in the function include:
  - `%0`, `%1`, `%3`, `%4`, `%5`, `%6`, `%7`, `%8`, `%9`, `%10`, `%11`, `%12`, `%13`, `%14`, `%15`, `%16`, `%17`, `%18`, `%19`, `%20`, `%21`, `%22`, `%23`, `%24`, `%25`, `%26`, `%27`, `%28`, `%29`, `%30`, `%31`, `%32`, `%33`, `%34`, `%35`, `%36`, `%37`, `%38`, `%39`, `%40`, `%41`, `%42`, `%43`, `%44`, `%45`, `%46`, `%47`, `%48`, `%49`, `%50`, `%51`, `%52`, `%53`, `%54`, `%55`, `%56`, `%57`, `%58`, `%59`, `%60`, `%61`, `%62`, `%63`, `%64`, `%65`, `%66`, `%67`, `%68`, `%69`, `%70`, `%71`, `%72`, `%73`, `%74`, `%75`, `%76`, `%77`, `%78`, `%79`, `%80`, `%81`, `%82`, `%83`, `%84`, `%85`, `%86`, `%87`, `%88`, `%89`, `%90`, `%91`, `%92`, `%93`, `%94`, `%95`, `%96`, `%97`, `%98`.

**Analyzing Dependencies:**
- Within the function, we observe that variables are defined and used in a way that they may be dependent on each other.
- Data dependencies can be inferred from the `load`, `store`, and `phi` operations. For example:
  - `%21`, `%22`, `%23`, and `%24` are defined based on previous values, indicating a dependency.
  - The variables `%5` and `%6` are loaded from pointers that are derived from `%1`, indicating a dependency relationship as well.

Given that many of the variables are interlinked through loads and stores, we conclude that there are data dependencies present among these variables.

### DOT File Representation of Dependencies

Here is the DOT file representation that outlines the data dependencies among the variables within the function:

### Conclusion
The analysis indicates that there are multiple data dependencies within the function. The DOT file representation illustrates these dependencies clearly. If you have specific variables or functions you'd like to analyze further or if you need adjustments to the DOT representation, please let me know!
