To analyze the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will identify variables and functions, analyze data dependencies among the variables, and generate a DOT file representing these dependencies.

### Analysis of the Provided IR Code

1. **Functions Identified**:
   - `@_Z10derivativeSt6vectorIfSaIfEE`

2. **Variables Identified**:
   - `%0`, `%1`, `%3`, `%4`, `%5`, `%6`, `%7`, `%9`, `%10`, `%11`, `%12`, `%13`, `%14`, `%15`, `%17`, `%18`, `%19`, `%20`, `%21`, `%22`, `%23`, `%24`, `%25`, `%26`, `%27`, `%28`, `%30`, `%32`, `%33`, `%34`, `%35`, `%36`, `%40`, `%41`, `%42`, `%43`, `%44`, `%45`, `%46`, `%47`, `%49`, `%50`, `%52`, `%54`, `%55`, `%56`, `%57`, `%58`, `%61`, `%62`, `%64`, `%66`, `%67`, `%68`, `%70`, `%71`, `%72`, `%73`, `%74`, `%75`, `%76`, `%77`, `%78`, `%79`, `%80`, `%82`, `%84`, `%86`, `%87`, `%89`, `%90`.

3. **Data Dependency Analysis**:
   - The variables `%0`, `%1`, and others are local to the function `@_Z10derivativeSt6vectorIfSaIfEE` and do not interact with any variables from other functions (as there are no other functions in the provided IR).
   - All operations in this function depend on the values of its parameters (`%0`, `%1`) and the results of previous computations.
   - Since there are no other functions to compare against, we will focus only on dependencies within this function.

4. **Dependency Relationships**:
   - For instance, `%21` is dependent on `%20` (a storage operation) and so forth. As we analyze the chains of dependencies, we find that there are mutual dependencies among several variables, particularly involving `phi` nodes and stores/loads.

5. **DOT File Representation**:
   - To represent these dependencies in a DOT file format, we will capture the relationships between the variables identified.
