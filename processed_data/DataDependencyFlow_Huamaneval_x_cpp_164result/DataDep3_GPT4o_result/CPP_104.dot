To analyze the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code and identify dependencies among variables, we will assess the data dependencies within the functions and across the entire code structure. 

### Analysis

1. **Identify Variables and Functions**: 
   The IR code contains multiple variables and functions. The key variables are represented by the `%` symbol, and various functions are defined using the `define` keyword.

2. **Analyze Dependencies**:
   - Each variable can potentially influence others if they are loaded, stored, or modified based on the values of other variables.
   - We will specifically look for whether the output of one variable is used as input to another, indicating a data dependency.

### Key Variables:
- Within the function `_Z13unique_digitsSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`, we have variables such as `%0`, `%1`, `%2`, `%3`, `%4`, etc.
- The variables `%100`, `%101`, `%102`, and others are involved in various operations.

### Dependency Relationships:
- For instance, the variables `%9`, `%10`, `%100`, and `%102` are loaded and compared, which creates a dependency chain.
- The use of `phi` nodes indicates that the variables depend on the flow of control, meaning they can have dependencies based on earlier definitions.

### Summary of Dependency Relationships:
- **Within the same function**: There are many dependencies as one variable's value is often used to compute another variable's value.
- **Across functions**: The variables seem to operate independently, as they belong to different functional contexts.

### Dependency Output:
For this analysis, we determine that:
- The variables within a single function exhibit dependencies (`yes`).
- Variables across functions do not exhibit direct dependencies (`no`).

### DOT File Representation:
Based on the above analysis, here's the DOT representation capturing the dependency relationships:

```dot
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    "unique_digits:%0" [label="Variable %0 in unique_digits"];
    "unique_digits:%1" [label="Variable %1 in unique_digits"];
    "unique_digits:%2" [label="Variable %2 in unique_digits"];
    "unique_digits:%3" [label="Variable %3 in unique_digits"];
    "unique_digits:%4" [label="Variable %4 in unique_digits"];
    "unique_digits:%6" [label="Variable %6 in unique_digits"];
    "unique_digits:%9" [label="Variable %9 in unique_digits"];
    "unique_digits:%10" [label="Variable %10 in unique_digits"];
    "unique_digits:%100" [label="Variable %100 in unique_digits"];
    "unique_digits:%101" [label="Variable %101 in unique_digits"];
    "unique_digits:%102" [label="Variable %102 in unique_digits"];
    "unique_digits:%103" [label="Variable %103 in unique_digits"];

    // Adding edges to represent dependencies
    "unique_digits:%9" -> "unique_digits:%10";
    "unique_digits:%9" -> "unique_digits:%100";
    "unique_digits:%10" -> "unique_digits:%101";
    "unique_digits:%100" -> "unique_digits:%102";
    "unique_digits:%101" -> "unique_digits:%103";
}
```

### Final Output
The variables inside the function exhibit dependencies due to their interactions, while there are no dependencies across different functions. Thus:

**Overall Conclusion**: 
- **Within Function**: `yes`
- **Across Functions**: `no`

The generated DOT file visualizes the dependencies among the variables in the `unique_digits` function, indicating how they interact with each other.
