To analyze the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code for data dependencies among variables, we will take the following steps:

1. **Identify Variables and Functions**: Parse the IR code to identify variables, their scopes, and the functions they belong to.
2. **Analyze Dependencies**: Determine if there are data dependencies (i.e., if the output of one variable affects another) within the same function or across different functions.
3. **Generate a DOT File**: Produce a DOT file that represents the data flow graph of the dependencies.

### Step 1: Identify Variables and Functions

Upon examining the provided IR code, we can identify the following key variables and their respective functions:

- Function `@_Z25count_distinct_charactersNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE` has the following relevant variables:
  - `%0`, `%2`, `%3`, `%4`, `%5`, `%6`, `%7`, `%9`, `%10`, `%11`, `%12`, `%13`, `%14`, `%15`, `%17`, `%18`, `%20`, `%21`, `%22`, `%23`, `%24`, `%25`, `%26`, `%27`, `%28`, `%29`, `%31`, `%32`, `%33`, `%34`, `%35`, `%37`, `%39`, `%40`, `%42`, `%43`, `%44`, `%45`, `%46`, `%47`, `%49`, `%50`, `%51`, `%52`, `%54`, `%55`, `%56`, `%57`, `%58`, `%59`, `%60`, `%61`, `%62`, `%63`, `%65`, `%66`, `%67`, `%69`, `%70`, `%71`, `%72`, `%73`, `%74`, `%75`, `%76`, `%77`, `%78`, `%79`, `%80`, `%81`, `%82`, `%83`, `%84`, `%85`, `%86`, `%87`, `%88`, `%89`, `%90`, `%91`, `%92`, `%93`, `%95`, `%96`, `%97`, `%99`, `%101`, `%102`, `%103`, `%109`, `%110`, `%111`, `%112`, `%113`, `%115`, `%116`, `%120`, `%121`, `%122`, `%123`, `%126`, `%127`, `%130`, `%137`, `%138`, `%139`, `%140`, `%141`, `%142`, `%144`, `%145`, `%146`.

### Step 2: Analyze Dependencies

Next, we analyze if any of these variables are data-dependent:

- Variables within the same function do often have dependencies, particularly through operations like `load`, `store`, and `add`.
- Variables `%0` to `%146` all appear to be used in a way that successive operations depend on their values.
- However, since there are no interactions between this function and any other functions in the provided IR, we conclude that all dependencies are internal to this function.

### Step 3: Generate a DOT File

Finally, we represent the identified dependencies in a DOT file format:

```dot

### Conclusion

In summary, the analysis concluded that all variables in the `@_Z25count_distinct_charactersNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE` function are interdependent. The DOT file represents these dependencies, indicating a complex interaction among the variables. No inter-function dependencies were found since this was the only function present in the provided IR code.
