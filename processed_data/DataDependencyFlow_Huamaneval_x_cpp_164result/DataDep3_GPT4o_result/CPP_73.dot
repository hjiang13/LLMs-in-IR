To analyze the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code for data dependencies and generate a DOT file, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify Variables and Functions**: We will parse the IR code to extract all variable names and their respective functions.
2. **Analyze Dependencies**: We will determine if there are data dependencies among the extracted variables.
3. **Generate DOT File**: We will create a DOT file representation of the dependencies.

### Step 1: Identify Variables and Functions

From the provided IR code, we can identify the following variables and functions:

- **Function**: `@_Z15smallest_changeSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`
- **Variables**:
  - `%0`: Input parameter of type `%"class.std::vector"*`
  - `%2`, `%3`, `%4`, `%5`, `%6`, `%7`, `%8`, `%9`, `%10`, `%11`, `%13`, `%15`, `%16`, `%17`, `%18`, `%19`, `%20`, `%21`, `%22`, `%23`, `%24`, `%25`, `%26`, `%27`, `%28`

### Step 2: Analyze Dependencies

Now, let's analyze the dependencies between these variables:

- `%3` and `%5` are loaded from `%2` and `%4` respectively which are based on `getelementptr` (GEP) instructions pointing to the input vector `%0`. Hence, there is a data dependency between:
  - `%2` (GEP) and `%3` (load from GEP)
  - `%4` (GEP) and `%5` (load from GEP)
  
- The variables `%6`, `%7` are derived from `%3` and `%5` through `ptrtoint` operations, leading to:
  - `%3` and `%6` (ptrtoint)
  - `%5` and `%7` (ptrtoint)

- `%8`, `%9`, `%10`, `%11` rely on the results of the previous computations, making them dependent on `%6`, `%7`, and the immediate results of arithmetic operations.

- The `%13`, `%15`, `%16`, `%17`, `%24`, `%25`, `%26`, `%27`, and `%28` are further dependent on results from earlier computations and `phi` nodes which indicate data flow from different branches. 

### Conclusion on Dependencies

Since all the variables are linked through these operations and load/store instructions, it can be concluded that the variables within the function are indeed data-dependent. 

### Step 3: Generate DOT File

The dependencies can be represented in a DOT file as follows:

```dot
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    "smallest_change:%0" [label="Input %0"];
    "smallest_change:%2" [label="GEP %2"];
    "smallest_change:%3" [label="Load %3"];
    "smallest_change:%4" [label="GEP %4"];
    "smallest_change:%5" [label="Load %5"];
    "smallest_change:%6" [label="ptrtoint %6"];
    "smallest_change:%7" [label="ptrtoint %7"];
    "smallest_change:%8" [label="sub %8"];
    "smallest_change:%9" [label="ashr %9"];
    "smallest_change:%10" [label="add %10"];
    "smallest_change:%11" [label="icmp %11"];
    "smallest_change:%13" [label="phi %13"];
    "smallest_change:%15" [label="phi %15"];
    "smallest_change:%16" [label="phi %16"];
    "smallest_change:%17" [label="phi %17"];
    "smallest_change:%24" [label="add %24"];
    "smallest_change:%25" [label="add %25"];
    "smallest_change:%26" [label="sub %26"];
    "smallest_change:%27" [label="add %27"];
    "smallest_change:%28" [label="icmp %28"];

    "smallest_change:%0" -> "smallest_change:%2" [label="yes"];
    "smallest_change:%2" -> "smallest_change:%3" [label="yes"];
    "smallest_change:%4" -> "smallest_change:%5" [label="yes"];
    "smallest_change:%3" -> "smallest_change:%6" [label="yes"];
    "smallest_change:%5" -> "smallest_change:%7" [label="yes"];
    "smallest_change:%6" -> "smallest_change:%8" [label="yes"];
    "smallest_change:%7" -> "smallest_change:%9" [label="yes"];
    "smallest_change:%9" -> "smallest_change:%10" [label="yes"];
    "smallest_change:%10" -> "smallest_change:%11" [label="yes"];
    "smallest_change:%11" -> "smallest_change:%13" [label="yes"];
    "smallest_change:%13" -> "smallest_change:%24" [label="yes"];
    "smallest_change:%15" -> "smallest_change:%25" [label="yes"];
    "smallest_change:%16" -> "smallest_change:%27" [label="yes"];
    "smallest_change:%17" -> "smallest_change:%24" [label="yes"];
}
```

In summary, all variables within the function exhibit data dependencies, and the DOT file illustrates these relationships effectively.
