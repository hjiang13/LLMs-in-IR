To analyze the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will identify the variables and functions, assess their data dependencies, and generate a DOT file representing these dependencies.

### Analysis of the Provided IR Code

1. **Identify Functions and Variables**:
   - The main function defined is `@_Z16filter_by_prefixSt6vectorINSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEESaIS5_EES5_`.
   - The variables include various `%` prefixed identifiers like `%0`, `%1`, `%2`, etc., which represent parameters and local allocations within the function.

2. **Analyze Dependencies**:
   - The function manipulates vectors and strings and performs operations like loading, storing, and comparing. 
   - There are references to variables from the same function (i.e., `%0`, `%1`, `%2`, etc.), but there are no cross-function dependencies provided in the code.

3. **Determine Dependencies**:
   - Variables like `%6` (a string) and `%8` (another string) are used in conditional branches and store operations. 
   - The function appears to manipulate strings and vectors in a way that suggests internal dependencies among variables, but no external dependencies (i.e., across different functions).
   - Each variable's state is contingent on previous operations within the same function scope.

### Data Dependency Relationships
- Variables within the same function are data-dependent if their values influence each other directly through load/store operations.
- Given this analysis, we can conclude that there are data dependencies among the variables within `@_Z16filter_by_prefixSt6vectorINSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEESaIS5_EES5_`.

### DOT File Representation

The DOT file will represent the internal dependencies of variables within the function. Hereâ€™s a sample representation:

```dot
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];

    "filter_by_prefix:%0" [label="Variable %0 in filter_by_prefix"];
    "filter_by_prefix:%1" [label="Variable %1 in filter_by_prefix"];
    "filter_by_prefix:%2" [label="Variable %2 in filter_by_prefix"];
    "filter_by_prefix:%6" [label="Variable %6 in filter_by_prefix"];
    "filter_by_prefix:%8" [label="Variable %8 in filter_by_prefix"];
    "filter_by_prefix:%10" [label="Variable %10 in filter_by_prefix"];
    
    // Indicate dependencies
    "filter_by_prefix:%1" -> "filter_by_prefix:%0";
    "filter_by_prefix:%6" -> "filter_by_prefix:%1";
    "filter_by_prefix:%8" -> "filter_by_prefix:%6";
    "filter_by_prefix:%10" -> "filter_by_prefix:%8";
}
```

### Summary

Label: **unknown**

Explanation: While there are internal dependencies among variables within the function `@_Z16filter_by_prefixSt6vectorINSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEESaIS5_EES5_`, it is unclear without additional context if these dependencies affect other functions or global states since no such relationships are depicted in the provided IR code.

The generated DOT file represents the internal dependencies but does not connect to other functions, reflecting the isolated nature of the analysis based solely on the provided code.
