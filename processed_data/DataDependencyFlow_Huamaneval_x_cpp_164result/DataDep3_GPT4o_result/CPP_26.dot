To analyze the given Intermediate Representation (IR) code and determine data dependency relationships, we will identify all variables and functions, analyze their dependencies, and generate a DOT representation for those dependencies.

### Analysis of the Given IR Code

The provided IR code contains multiple variables (pointers, integers) and several function calls. Based on the operations in the IR code, we will assess whether certain variables are dependent on each other.

1. **Functions and Variables**: The main function is `@_Z17remove_duplicatesSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`. Inside this function, several variables are defined, including pointers (e.g., `%0`, `%1`, `%2`, etc.) and their dependencies are analyzed based on storage, loading, and manipulation.

2. **Dependency Analysis**:
   - The function manipulates a vector and performs comparisons and arithmetic on the loaded values.
   - Variables like `%6`, `%7`, `%10`, `%11`, etc., are all interdependent within the flow of the function based on load/store operations.
   - There are also `phi` nodes, which indicate multiple incoming values that can influence the final outcome, leading to further dependencies.

3. **Cross-Function Dependencies**: Since the provided code seems to focus solely on one function without any external calls shown, we'll assume that no external dependencies exist for this analysis.

### Data Dependency Relationships

In the context of the provided IR code:
- **Data-Dependent Variables**: Variables that are loaded/stored in a way that their values are influenced by previous operations.
- **Non-Dependent Variables**: Variables that do not interact directly or indirectly.
- **Unknown Dependencies**: Variables where the relationship cannot be determined due to the complexity of the flow or lack of information.

### Conclusion

From the analysis, it is evident that there are various direct and indirect dependencies among the variables within the function. The relationships can be labeled as follows:

- Variables `%6`, `%7`, `%10`, `%11` and others are data-dependent (`yes`).
- Variables across different function contexts (if they existed) would likely be labeled as `no` for this specific function context since no external modifications are evident.

### DOT File Representation

Here's how we would represent the dependencies in a DOT file:

```dot
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    "remove_duplicates:%6" [label="Variable %6 in remove_duplicates"];
    "remove_duplicates:%7" [label="Variable %7 in remove_duplicates"];
    "remove_duplicates:%10" [label="Variable %10 in remove_duplicates"];
    "remove_duplicates:%11" [label="Variable %11 in remove_duplicates"];
    "remove_duplicates:%12" [label="Variable %12 in remove_duplicates"];
    "remove_duplicates:%13" [label="Variable %13 in remove_duplicates"];
    "remove_duplicates:%14" [label="Variable %14 in remove_duplicates"];
    // Add additional variables as necessary
    "remove_duplicates:%6" -> "remove_duplicates:%10" [label="yes"];
    "remove_duplicates:%7" -> "remove_duplicates:%11" [label="yes"];
    // Additional dependencies can be added based on further analysis
}
```

### Final Output

- **Label**: yes
- **Explanation**: Variables within the function `@_Z17remove_duplicatesSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` are data-dependent based on the operations performed on them, especially with regards to loading and storing values that are influenced by each other.

This concludes the analysis of the IR code provided.
