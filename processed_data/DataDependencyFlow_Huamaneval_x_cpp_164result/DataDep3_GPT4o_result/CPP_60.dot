### Analysis of the Given IR Code

In the provided IR code, we have a single function `@_Z8sum_to_ni` which takes an integer input `%0` and performs several operations. Let's break down the operations and analyze the dependencies:

1. **Variables Identified**:
   - `%0`: Input parameter.
   - `%2`: Result of `add nsw i32 %0, 1`.
   - `%3`: Result of `mul nsw i32 %2, %0`.
   - `%4`: Result of `sdiv i32 %3, 2`.

2. **Dependencies**:
   - `%2` is dependent on `%0` because it uses `%0` in its computation.
   - `%3` is dependent on both `%2` and `%0` since it uses both in its computation (`%3 = mul nsw i32 %2, %0`).
   - `%4` is dependent on `%3` because it uses `%3` in its computation (`%4 = sdiv i32 %3, 2`).

Given this analysis, we can summarize the dependencies as follows:
- `%2` has a data dependency on `%0`: **yes**
- `%3` has a data dependency on `%0` and `%2`: **yes**
- `%4` has a data dependency on `%3`: **yes**

Since all variables are contained within a single function, there are no dependencies between different functions (as there is only one function present).

### DOT File Representation

The DOT file will represent the data dependencies as a directed graph:

```dot
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    "sum_to_ni:%0" [label="Variable %0 in sum_to_ni"];
    "sum_to_ni:%2" [label="Variable %2 in sum_to_ni"];
    "sum_to_ni:%3" [label="Variable %3 in sum_to_ni"];
    "sum_to_ni:%4" [label="Variable %4 in sum_to_ni"];

    "sum_to_ni:%0" -> "sum_to_ni:%2" [label="yes"];
    "sum_to_ni:%0" -> "sum_to_ni:%3" [label="yes"];
    "sum_to_ni:%2" -> "sum_to_ni:%3" [label="yes"];
    "sum_to_ni:%3" -> "sum_to_ni:%4" [label="yes"];
}
```

### Final Summary

The analysis indicates that all variables are data-dependent on their predecessors within the single function, leading to a straightforward representation in the DOT file, which captures these relationships accurately.
