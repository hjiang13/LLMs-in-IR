To represent the data flow in the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can outline a data flow graph using nodes and edges. Each node will represent either a variable or an operation, while edges will illustrate the data dependencies between these nodes. Below is the description of the nodes and edges, followed by a suggestion for visualizing the graph diagrammatically using the DOT language.

### Data Flow Graph Description

#### Nodes
1. **Function Entry**: `_Z14circular_shiftB5cxx11ii`
2. **Variables**:
   - `%0`: Input string (type: `%"class.std::__cxx11::basic_string"*`)
   - `%1`: Integer parameter
   - `%2`: Integer parameter
   - `%4`, `%5`, `%6`: Local variables (allocated on the stack)
   - `%7`, `%8`, `%9`, `%10`, `%11`: Local `basic_string` objects (allocated on the stack)
   - `%12`: Pointer to memory (type: `i8*`)
   - `%13`: Pointer to the internal structure of `%7`
   - `%19`: Pointer to `i8*` (represents the data in the string)
   - `%20`, `%21`: Intermediate pointers for internal structure
   - `%22`: Pointer to the internal structure of `%8`
   - `%39`: Pointer to intermediate data storage
   - `%56`: Pointer to resultant data storage (based on conditions)
   - `%62`, `%63`: Temporary integer variables for calculations
   - `%72`: Result of a comparison (used in a branch)
   - `%74`: Result from another function call (to create or modify a string)
   - `%215`: Pointer for the final string storage
   - `%243`: Pointer for the string after copying or appending

3. **Operations**:
   - `alloca`: Memory allocation for local variables
   - `call`: Function calls (e.g., `@llvm.lifetime.start`, `@llvm.memcpy`, etc.)
   - `load`: Loading values from specified memory locations
   - `store`: Storing values into specified memory locations
   - `icmp`: Integer comparison operations
   - `getelementptr`: Pointer arithmetic to access elements within structures

4. **Control Flow**:
   - `invoke`: Invocation of functions with possible exceptions
   - `br`: Branching statements that direct the flow depending on conditions
   - `switch`: Switch statements for multi-way branching

#### Edges
- **Input Parameters**: Connects `%0`, `%1`, and `%2` to the function entry node.
- **Data Flow**:
  - From `%0` to `%7` and `%8` as they are initialized.
  - From `%7` to `%13`, representing the internal structure of the string being accessed.
  - From `%19` to `%20`, illustrating the loading of internal data.
  - From `%22` to `%21` as the internal structure of `%8` is accessed.
  - Pointers `%39`, `%56`, `%62`, `%63`, etc., connect various computation results back into the flow.
- **Function Calls**: Each `call` and `invoke` will connect to the respective operation nodes, showing where results are produced.
- **Branching**: The edges will go from comparison operations (`icmp`) to their respective branches, depicting the control flow decisions.

### Visualization in DOT Format
You can visualize this graph using the DOT language as follows:

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    // Nodes
    Entry [label="Function Entry: _Z14circular_shiftB5cxx11ii"];
    InputString [label="%0: Input String"];
    Param1 [label="%1: Integer Parameter"];
    Param2 [label="%2: Integer Parameter"];
    LocalVar1 [label="%4: Local Var 1"];
    LocalVar2 [label="%5: Local Var 2"];
    LocalVar3 [label="%6: Local Var 3"];
    BasicString1 [label="%7: Local basic_string"];
    BasicString2 [label="%8: Local basic_string"];
    Pointer1 [label="%12: Memory Pointer"];
    Pointer2 [label="%13: Internal Pointer of %7"];
    Pointer3 [label="%19: Pointer to data"];
    Pointer4 [label="%22: Pointer to internal structure of %8"];
    ResultPointer [label="%215: Result Pointer"];
    FunctionCall [label="Function Call"];
    
    // Edges
    Entry -> InputString;
    Entry -> Param1;
    Entry -> Param2;
    Entry -> LocalVar1;
    Entry -> LocalVar2;
    Entry -> LocalVar3;
    Entry -> BasicString1;
    Entry -> BasicString2;
    
    InputString -> BasicString1;
    BasicString1 -> Pointer2;
    Pointer2 -> Pointer3;
    BasicString2 -> Pointer4;
    
    Pointer3 -> ResultPointer;
    
    // More edges can be added based on specific operations, branching, etc.
}
```

### Diagrammatic Visualization
To visualize the above DOT format:
1. Use a graph visualization tool such as Graphviz (http://www.graphviz.org/).
2. Save the DOT code in a file (e.g., `data_flow_graph.dot`).
3. Use the command line to generate an image: `dot -Tpng data_flow_graph.dot -o data_flow_graph.png`.
4. Open the generated image file to view the data flow graph.

This graph will provide a clear representation of how data flows through the function, highlighting variable dependencies and operations, making it easier to analyze the code structure and data transformations.
