To create a data flow graph (DFG) from the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we can break down the operations and data usage into nodes and edges. Below is a detailed description of the data flow graph, followed by a suggested way to visualize it diagrammatically using the DOT format.

### Nodes
1. **Input Node**
   - `%0`: Input parameter of type `basic_string`.

2. **Get Element Pointer Operation**
   - `%2`: Result of `getelementptr` operation that retrieves a pointer within the `basic_string`.

3. **Load Operation**
   - `%3`: Result of the `load` operation that fetches the actual string (pointer to `i8*`) from the address computed in `%2`.

4. **Function Call**
   - `%4`: Result of the call to `@strtod`, which converts the string in `%3` to a double.

5. **Rounding Operation**
   - `%5`: Result of the call to `@llvm.round.f64`, which rounds the double value from `%4`.

6. **Type Conversion Operation**
   - `%6`: Result of the conversion from double to integer using `fptosi`.

7. **Return Node**
   - `Return`: Final return value, which is the integer value in `%6`.

### Edges
- **Edge from Input Node to Get Element Pointer Operation:**
  - `%0` → `%2`
  - This edge indicates that the input parameter `%0` is used to compute the address in `%2`.

- **Edge from Get Element Pointer Operation to Load Operation:**
  - `%2` → `%3`
  - This edge shows that the pointer from `%2` is used to load the string in `%3`.

- **Edge from Load Operation to Function Call:**
  - `%3` → `%4`
  - This edge indicates that the loaded string value from `%3` is passed to the `@strtod` function.

- **Edge from Function Call to Rounding Operation:**
  - `%4` → `%5`
  - This edge shows that the output of `@strtod` (located in `%4`) is used as input for the rounding operation in `%5`.

- **Edge from Rounding Operation to Type Conversion Operation:**
  - `%5` → `%6`
  - This edge indicates that the rounded double value from `%5` is converted to an integer in `%6`.

- **Edge from Type Conversion Operation to Return Node:**
  - `%6` → `Return`
  - This edge shows that the final integer result in `%6` is returned from the function.

### Visualization in DOT Format
Here is how this data flow graph can be represented in DOT format:

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    // Nodes
    Input [label="%0 (Input: basic_string)"];
    GEP [label="%2 (getelementptr)"];
    Load [label="%3 (load i8*)"];
    StrToD [label="%4 (strtod)"];
    Round [label="%5 (llvm.round.f64)"];
    FPToSI [label="%6 (fptosi)"];
    Return [label="Return"];

    // Edges
    Input -> GEP;
    GEP -> Load;
    Load -> StrToD;
    StrToD -> Round;
    Round -> FPToSI;
    FPToSI -> Return;
}
```

### Diagrammatic Representation
This DOT representation can be visualized using tools like Graphviz. The nodes represent the different stages of computation and data handling, while the directed edges indicate the flow of data and dependencies between these operations. 

When visualized, the nodes will be arranged, and the directed edges will show how data flows through the function, clearly illustrating the dependencies and the sequence of operations.
