To create a data flow graph based on your provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will outline the nodes and edges that represent variables, operations, and control flow. The graph will capture how data flows through the various operations and their dependencies.

### Data Flow Graph Structure

#### Nodes
1. **Entry Node**: `Entry`
2. **Comparison Node**: `cmp_slt_0_2` (i.e., `%2 = icmp slt i64 %0, 2`)
3. **Branch Node**: `br_2`
4. **Comparison Node**: `cmp_slt_0_4` (i.e., `%4 = icmp slt i64 %0, 4`)
5. **Branch Node**: `br_4`
6. **Phi Node**: `phi_6` (i.e., `%6 = phi i64 [ %9, %5 ], [ 2, %3 ]`)
7. **Modulo Node**: `srem_7` (i.e., `%7 = srem i64 %0, %6`)
8. **Comparison Node**: `cmp_eq_7_0` (i.e., `%8 = icmp eq i64 %7, 0`)
9. **Addition Node**: `add_nuw_9` (i.e., `%9 = add nuw nsw i64 %6, 1`)
10. **Multiplication Node**: `mul_nsw_10` (i.e., `%10 = mul nsw i64 %9, %9`)
11. **Comparison Node**: `cmp_gt_10_0` (i.e., `%11 = icmp sgt i64 %10, %0`)
12. **Select Node**: `select_12` (i.e., `%12 = select i1 %8, i1 true, i1 %11`)
13. **Branch Node**: `br_12`
14. **XOR Node**: `xor_14` (i.e., `%14 = xor i1 %8, true`)
15. **Merge Node**: `merge_15` (i.e., `%16 = phi i1 [ false, %1 ], [ true, %3 ], [ %14, %13 ]`)
16. **Return Node**: `ret_16`

#### Edges
1. **Entry → cmp_slt_0_2**: Data flows from entry to the first comparison.
2. **cmp_slt_0_2 → br_2**: The result of the comparison determines the control flow.
3. **br_2 → cmp_slt_0_4**: If the condition is true, flow goes to the second comparison.
4. **br_2 → merge_15**: If false, it jumps to the merge node.
5. **cmp_slt_0_4 → br_4**: The result of the second comparison determines the next flow.
6. **br_4 → phi_6**: If the condition is true, flow goes to the phi node.
7. **br_4 → merge_15**: If false, it also goes to the merge node.
8. **phi_6 → srem_7**: The value from the phi node feeds into the modulo operation.
9. **srem_7 → cmp_eq_7_0**: The result from the modulo feeds into the equality check.
10. **cmp_eq_7_0 → select_12**: The result of the equality check determines the select condition.
11. **add_nuw_9 → mul_nsw_10**: The result from the addition feeds into the multiplication operation.
12. **mul_nsw_10 → cmp_gt_10_0**: The multiplication result feeds into the greater-than comparison.
13. **cmp_gt_10_0 → select_12**: The result of the comparison determines the second input to the select operation.
14. **select_12 → br_12**: The result of the select operation determines the flow to the next branch.
15. **br_12 → xor_14**: The flow goes to the XOR operation.
16. **xor_14 → merge_15**: The result flows into the merge node.
17. **merge_15 → ret_16**: The final result is returned.

### Dot File Representation

The following is a simple representation of the above structure in dot format:

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    Entry -> cmp_slt_0_2;
    cmp_slt_0_2 -> br_2;
    br_2 -> cmp_slt_0_4;
    br_2 -> merge_15;
    cmp_slt_0_4 -> br_4;
    br_4 -> phi_6;
    br_4 -> merge_15;
    phi_6 -> srem_7;
    srem_7 -> cmp_eq_7_0;
    cmp_eq_7_0 -> select_12;
    add_nuw_9 -> mul_nsw_10;
    mul_nsw_10 -> cmp_gt_10_0;
    cmp_gt_10_0 -> select_12;
    select_12 -> br_12;
    br_12 -> xor_14;
    xor_14 -> merge_15;
    merge_15 -> ret_16;
}
```

### Visualization Suggestions

To visualize the above graph, you can use various tools that support the DOT format such as:

- **Graphviz**: A powerful tool that allows you to generate visual representations of graphs from DOT files. You can create a PNG, PDF, or SVG file from the DOT representation.
- **Online Graphviz Viewer**: There are online tools where you can paste the DOT code and visualize the graph without needing local installations.

This graph illustrates the flow of data, highlighting dependencies between operations and their control flow, making it easier to analyze the logic of the provided IR code.
