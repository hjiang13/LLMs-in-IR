To create a data flow graph (DFG) from the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we can outline the nodes and their relationships based on the operations and data dependencies found in the code. Below is a detailed text description of the nodes and edges, followed by a suggestion for how to visualize it diagrammatically.

### Nodes
Each node represents either a variable, an operation, or a basic block label. The nodes are as follows:

1. **Function Entry**: `_Z12match_parensSt6vector...`
2. **Allocations**:
   - `%3` (alloca for `i64`)
   - `%4` (alloca for `i64`)
   - `%5` (alloca for `basic_string`)
   - `%6` (alloca for `basic_string`)
7. **Loads**:
   - `%9` (load from vector)
   - `%13` (load from basic string)
   - `%15` (load from basic string)
   - `%21` (load from `basic_string`)
   - `%37` (load from `basic_string`)
   - `%43` (load from `basic_string`)
   - `%151` (load from `basic_string`)
8. **Stores**:
   - Store operations to `%4`, `%5`, `%6`, etc.
9. **Comparison operations**:
   - `%17` (comparison result)
   - `%44` (comparison result)
   - `%46` (comparison result)
   - `%49` (comparison result)
   - `%61` (comparison result)
   - `%70`, `%72`, `%75`, etc. (various comparisons)
10. **Function Calls**:
    - Call to `@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8`
    - Call to `@llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64`
    - Call to `_ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_string...`
11. **Basic Block Labels**:
    - `%2`, `%18`, `%20`, `%25`, `%30`, `%41`, `%48`, `%50`, `%56`, `%119`, `%125`, `%198`, `%207`, etc.

### Edges
Edges represent the flow of data between nodes, indicating dependencies. Below are some key edges based on the operations and data dependencies:

1. **Function Entry** to **Allocations**: The entry point leads to allocating space for local variables.
2. **Allocations** to **Loads**: Data flows from the allocated memory to the variables that load data from it.
3. **Loads** to **Stores**: Loaded values are stored back into allocated memory or other variables.
4. **Comparison operations** produce results that influence control flow through branches (e.g., conditional jumps).
5. **Function Calls** introduce dependencies where the output of one function may affect subsequent operations, such as:
   - `%21` (result of `@_ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_string...`) feeds into a store operation.
   - Output of comparisons directs control flow, influencing branches and resulting operations.
6. **Basic Block Labels** connect to other blocks based on control flow, showing the path taken depending on conditions evaluated.

### Visualization
To visualize this diagrammatically, you could use the DOT language to create a graph. The following is a basic structure in DOT format:

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    rankdir=LR; // Left to right layout

    // Function Entry
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="_Z12match_parensSt6vector..."];
    
    // Allocations
    alloc3 [label="%3 (alloca i64)"];
    alloc4 [label="%4 (alloca i64)"];
    alloc5 [label="%5 (alloca basic_string)"];
    alloc6 [label="%6 (alloca basic_string)"];

    // Loads
    load9 [label="%9 (load from vector)"];
    load13 [label="%13 (load from basic_string)"];
    load15 [label="%15 (load from basic_string)"];
    load21 [label="%21 (load from basic_string)"];
    // ...

    // Comparison nodes
    cmp17 [label="%17 (cmp)"];
    cmp44 [label="%44 (cmp)"];
    
    // Function Calls
    callAppend [label="call _ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_string..."];
    callMemcpy [label="call llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64"];

    // Basic Block Labels
    block2 [label="%2"];
    block25 [label="%25"];
    
    // Edges
    entry -> alloc3;
    entry -> alloc4;
    entry -> alloc5;
    entry -> alloc6;
    alloc5 -> load9;
    load9 -> storeX; // Replace 'storeX' with actual store node
    cmp17 -> block25;
    // Add additional edges as needed
}
```

### Summary
This graph represents the flow of data through the function, showing how variables are created, modified, evaluated, and used in operations, as well as indicating how control flows through the function. Each node can be customized further to represent specific operations or variable types, and additional edges can be added to fully capture the complexity of the data flow.
