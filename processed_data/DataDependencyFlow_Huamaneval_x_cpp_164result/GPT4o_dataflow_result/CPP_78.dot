To create a data flow graph (DFG) for the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we need to identify the key components of the code, including variables, operations, and control flow. The DFG will consist of nodes representing variables and operations, and edges representing data dependencies between them.

### Data Flow Graph Description

#### Nodes
1. **Function Entry**: `@_Z7hex_keyNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`
2. **Allocations**: 
   - `%2`: Allocation of `basic_string`
   - `%3`: Bitcast of `%2` to `i8*`
3. **Lifetime Operations**: 
   - `llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8`
   - `llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8`
4. **GEP Operations**:
   - `%4`: GEP for storing in `union.anon`
   - `%7`: Storing `i64 6` in `basic_string`
   - `%9`: Loading `i64` from `basic_string` 
   - `%10`: Load operation result from `%9`
5. **Control Flow**:
   - `icmp eq` operations (comparison checks): `%11`, `%31`, `%33`, `%35`, `%37`, `%39`, `%41`
   - `br` statements (branching): various labels including `%12`, `%26`, `%32`, `%34`, `%36`, `%38`, `%40`, `%43`, `%50`
6. **Phi Nodes**:
   - `%27`, `%28`: For handling control flow from different branches
   - `%44`: For final decision making in loop

#### Edges (Data Dependencies)
- **From Allocations**:
  - `%2` → `%3`: `%3` depends on `%2`
- **From Lifetime Operations**:
  - `%3` → `llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8`: Start lifetime for `%3`
  - `%3` → `llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8`: End lifetime for `%3`
- **From GEP and Store Operations**:
  - `%4` → `store` operation to `%5`: `%4` is stored in `%5`
  - `%4` → `%6`: `%4` is used in `llvm.memcpy`
  - `%7` → `%9`: `%7` is the destination for the length of the string
  - `%9` → `%10`: `%10` is loaded from `%9`
- **From Control Flow**:
  - `%10` → `%11`: `%11` compares `%10` to `0`
  - `%15` → `%30`: Values loaded from `%6` used in comparison against `%30`
  - Values from `%27`, `%28`, `%44` are passed along various branches and influence the flow of the program.

### Visualization

To visualize the DFG, the following approach can be used:

1. **Graph Creation**: Use the DOT language to create the graph. Each node can be represented with a label that corresponds to the function, variable name, or operation type.
2. **Edges**: Draw directed edges from source nodes to target nodes based on the dependencies outlined above.
3. **Graphical Tools**: Use tools like Graphviz to render the DOT file into a graphical representation.

### Example DOT Format

Here's an example of what the DOT file might look like:

```dot
digraph DFG {
    rankdir=LR;
    
    FunctionEntry [label="@_Z7hex_keyNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE"];
    Alloc [label="%2 (alloc)"];
    LifetimeStart [label="llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8"];
    LifetimeEnd [label="llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8"];
    GEP1 [label="%4 (GEP)"];
    Store1 [label="store length"];
    Load1 [label="load from %9"];
    Compare1 [label="icmp eq %10, 0"];
    Branch1 [label="br %11"];

    FunctionEntry -> Alloc;
    Alloc -> LifetimeStart;
    LifetimeStart -> LifetimeEnd;
    Alloc -> GEP1;
    GEP1 -> Store1;
    Store1 -> Load1;
    Load1 -> Compare1;

    // Continue adding edges for other operations and branches
}
```

In this manner, you can build a complete data flow graph that captures the flow of data and control through your IR code. Each node can be expanded or modified to include more details as necessary for your analysis.
