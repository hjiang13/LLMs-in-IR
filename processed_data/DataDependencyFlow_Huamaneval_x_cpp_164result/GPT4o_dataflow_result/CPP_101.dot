To create a data flow graph (DFG) from the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we will represent variables, operations, function calls, and control flows as nodes and the dependencies between them as edges. 

### Nodes:
1. **Parameters and Return Values**
   - `@_Z12words_string(...)` - Entry point of the function, with parameters including a vector and a string.

2. **Allocations**
   - `%3`, `%4`, `%5`, `%6`, `%7`, `%8` - These represent allocated space for integers and strings.
   - `%9`, `%10`, `%11`, `%12`, `%13` - Intermediate allocations and pointers for `basic_string`.

3. **Memory Operations**
   - `llvm.lifetime.start` - Memory management operations start.
   - `llvm.memset` - For initializing memory.

4. **Load Operations**
   - `load i8*` - Loading pointers from the string structures.
   - `load i64` - Loading integer values from the string structures.

5. **Store Operations**
   - `store i8*` - Storing pointers back into string structures.
   - `store i64` - Storing integer values back into the respective allocated locations.

6. **Control Flow Nodes**
   - `br` (branch) - Represents conditional branches.
   - `switch` - Represents switch-case structures.
   - `invoke` - Represents function calls that can unwind.

7. **Function Calls**
   - Various calls to `@llvm.memcpy`, `@llvm.lifetime.end`, `@_ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_string...` - Calls to manage memory and perform operations on strings.

8. **Cleanup and Exception Handling**
   - `landingpad` - Nodes for exception handling.

### Edges:
- **Data dependencies:** 
  - From loads to their respective store operations.
  - Between allocation nodes and their subsequent use in `store` or `load`.
- **Control dependencies:**
  - From branch conditions to the respective branches.
  - From invokes to their unwind labels.
- **Function call dependencies:**
  - From parameters passed to function calls to their respective invocation.

### Dot Representation:
```dot
digraph G {
    // Parameters
    Entry [label="Entry: @_Z12words_string(...)"];
    
    // Allocations
    Alloc1 [label="%3 (alloc i64)"];
    Alloc2 [label="%4 (alloc i64)"];
    Alloc3 [label="%5 (alloc i64)"];
    Alloc4 [label="%6 (alloc basic_string)"];
    Alloc5 [label="%7 (alloc basic_string)"];
    Alloc6 [label="%8 (alloc basic_string)"];

    // Load and Store Operations
    Load1 [label="Load i8*"];
    Load2 [label="Load i64"];
    Store1 [label="Store i8*"];
    Store2 [label="Store i64"];

    // Control Flow Nodes
    Branch1 [label="Branch (condition)"];
    Branch2 [label="Switch (case)"];
    
    // Function Calls
    FuncCall1 [label="@llvm.memcpy"];
    FuncCall2 [label="@llvm.lifetime.start"];
    FuncCall3 [label="@_ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_string..."];

    // Cleanup
    Cleanup [label="LandingPad"];

    // Edges
    Entry -> Alloc1;
    Entry -> Alloc2;
    Entry -> Alloc3;
    Entry -> Alloc4;
    Entry -> Alloc5;
    Entry -> Alloc6;

    Alloc1 -> Load1;
    Alloc2 -> Load2;
    Load1 -> Store1;
    Load2 -> Store2;

    Entry -> Branch1;
    Branch1 -> FuncCall1; // Example function call based on the branch
    Branch1 -> Branch2;   // Conditional flow leading to switch
    Branch2 -> FuncCall2; // Function call based on switch case

    FuncCall1 -> Cleanup; // Example of cleanup after function call

    // Add more edges as per the actual data flow
}
```

### Visualization:
- This graph can be visualized using Graphviz or similar tools that can interpret the DOT format. 
- Each node can be represented as a box containing the label, while directed edges can be arrows connecting the boxes based on dependencies.

### Summary:
- The DFG captures the essential flow of data through variables and operations in the IR code. 
- The nodes represent key operations, allocations, and control flow, while the edges illustrate how data moves between these operations.
- By visualizing this graph, one can gain insights into the dependencies and control structures present in the code.
