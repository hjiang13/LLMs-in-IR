### Visualization Suggestions
To visualize this graph:
1. Use Graphviz software (e.g., `dot` command-line tool) to render the DOT format into a graphical representation.
2. Save the DOT content into a `.dot` file and run the following command:
   ```bash
   dot -Tpng filename.dot -o output.png
   ```
3. This will generate a PNG image visualizing the data flow graph, with nodes representing variables and operations, and edges showing data dependencies.

By following this structure, you can effectively analyze the data flow within the given IR code.
