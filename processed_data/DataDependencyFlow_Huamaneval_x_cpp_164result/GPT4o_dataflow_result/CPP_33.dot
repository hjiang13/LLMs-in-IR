To create a data flow graph (DFG) based on the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, I will outline the key nodes (representing variables, operations, and control flow structures) along with the edges that indicate dependencies between them. In the description, I will reference the names of the nodes and their relationships without detailing the content of each basic block.

### Data Flow Graph Outline

#### Nodes
1. **Function Node: `_Z10sort_thirdSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`**
   - Represents the entry point of the function.

2. **Basic Block Nodes:**
   - **BB2**: Initial checks and loading of pointers.
   - **BB8**: Main loop with several phi nodes.
   - **BB18**: Data movement and checks.
   - **BB20**: Length checks and potential throw.
   - **BB26**: Exception handling block.
   - **BB28**: Memory allocation and manipulation.
   - **BB37**: Invoke sort functions.
   - **BB42**: Memory handling and conditional jumps.
   - **BB54**: Cleanup and memory deallocation.
   - **BB58**: Loop continuation with phi nodes.
   - **BB92**: Final operations before function exit including cleanup.
   - **BB101**: Return and end of function.

3. **Function Call Nodes:**
   - **Function: `@llvm.memset.p0i8.i64`**
   - **Function: `@llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64`**
   - **Function: `_ZdlPv`** (deallocation)
   - **Function: `_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc`** (throwing error)
   - **Function: `_Znwm`** (memory allocation)
   - **Functions: `_ZSt16__introsort_loop...` and `_ZSt22__final_insertion_sort...`** (sorting functions)

#### Edges
- **Control Flow Edges:**
  - From the function entry node to the initial basic block (BB2).
  - Between basic blocks indicating the flow of execution (e.g., BB2 to BB8, BB8 to BB18, etc.).
  - Conditional edges based on comparisons (e.g., BB8 to BB20 if a condition holds true).

- **Data Dependency Edges:**
  - From load operations to the variables they affect (e.g., results from loads in BB18 affecting stores in BB42).
  - From phi nodes in BB58 feeding into computations in BB8.
  - Between memory allocation nodes and their subsequent uses in operations.

- **Function Call Edges:**
  - From the main function node to each invoked function, indicating the control transfer to those functions.
  - Back edges from return points of called functions to the calling function to indicate continuation.

### Suggested Visualization
To visualize this DFG diagrammatically, you could use a graph visualization tool like Graphviz. Below is a basic structure of how the dot format might look:

```dot
digraph DFG {
    rankdir=TB;
    
    // Function Node
    Function [label="_Z10sort_thirdSt6vectorIiSaIiEE", shape="ellipse"];
    
    // Basic Block Nodes
    BB2 [label="BB2"];
    BB8 [label="BB8"];
    BB18 [label="BB18"];
    BB20 [label="BB20"];
    BB26 [label="BB26"];
    BB28 [label="BB28"];
    BB37 [label="BB37"];
    BB42 [label="BB42"];
    BB54 [label="BB54"];
    BB58 [label="BB58"];
    BB92 [label="BB92"];
    BB101 [label="BB101"];

    // Function Calls
    Memset [label="@llvm.memset.p0i8.i64", shape="box"];
    Memmove [label="@llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64", shape="box"];
    Dealloc [label="_ZdlPv", shape="box"];
    Throw [label="_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc", shape="box"];
    Alloc [label="_Znwm", shape="box"];
    Introsort [label="_ZSt16__introsort_loop...", shape="box"];
    FinalSort [label="_ZSt22__final_insertion_sort...", shape="box"];

    // Edges
    Function -> BB2;
    BB2 -> BB8;
    BB8 -> BB18;
    BB18 -> BB20;
    BB20 -> BB26;
    BB20 -> BB28;
    BB26 -> BB58;
    BB58 -> BB92;
    BB92 -> BB101;

    // Function Calls
    BB20 -> Memset;
    BB28 -> Alloc;
    BB37 -> Introsort;
    BB42 -> Memmove;
    BB54 -> Dealloc;
    BB20 -> Throw;

    // Additional edges for data dependencies can be added based on specific variables.
}
```

You can add more specific edges for data dependencies between nodes based on the variables and their flows to provide a more comprehensive picture. Each edge represents a relationship between the nodes, indicating how data flows from one operation or variable to another. The choice of shapes (ellipse for functions, box for operations) helps in distinguishing between different types of nodes visually.
