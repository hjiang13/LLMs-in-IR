To analyze the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can create a Data Flow Graph (DFG). This graph will consist of nodes representing variables, operations, and function calls, alongside directed edges that indicate dependencies.

### Data Flow Graph Description

1. **Nodes**:
   - **Function Definitions**:
     - `@_Z19filter_by_substringSt6vectorINSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEESaIS5_EES5_`
     - `@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8`
     - `@llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8`
     - Other function declarations like `@__cxa_begin_catch`, `@__cxa_end_catch`, etc.

   - **Variables**:
     - `%0` - Input vector (class.std::vector)
     - `%1` - Input vector (class.std::vector)
     - `%2` - Input string (class.std::__cxx11::basic_string)
     - `%4` - Local allocation (i64)
     - `%5` - Bitcast of `%0`
     - `%6`, `%7`, `%8`, `%9`, `%10`, `%11` - GEPs (getelementptr) for accessing elements in vectors and strings.
     - `%13`, `%14`, `%18` - Loaded strings from vectors.
     - `%15`, `%22`, `%23` - Comparison results and control flow variables.
     - `%31`, `%37`, `%39` - Length checks and comparisons.
     - `%47`, `%52`, `%57` - Outputs from function calls and memory operations.
     - `%62` - Loop control variable.
     - `%71` - Final return point.

   - **Operations**:
     - `alloca`, `load`, `store`, `bitcast`, `getelementptr`, `icmp` (comparison), `br` (branch), `call`, `invoke`, etc.

2. **Edges**:
   - **Data Dependencies**:
     - Data flows from input vectors and strings (nodes `%0`, `%1`, `%2`) to various operations, such as loads and comparisons.
     - The output of the `load` instructions feeds into comparison operations, which then lead to control flow decisions (branches).
     - Function calls such as `@_ZNKSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE4findEPKcmm` receive specific arguments, and their results influence subsequent branches.
     - Returns and control variables (like `%62` for loops) guide the flow of execution through the graph.

### Suggested Visualization

To visualize this Data Flow Graph diagrammatically:
- **Nodes** can be represented as circles or boxes with the titles of the functions, variables, and operations inside them.
- **Edges** can be arrows connecting these nodes, showing the flow of data from one node to another.
- Color coding can be used to differentiate between variable nodes, operation nodes, and function nodes.
- Loop structures can be highlighted with circular arrows to indicate the cyclic nature of the flow.
- Control flow can be indicated with dashed lines to show conditional branches.

### Example DOT File Representation

Here is an example of how the DFG might be represented in DOT format:

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    // Function Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    filter_by_substring [label="@_Z19filter_by_substringSt6vector..."];
    lifetime_start [label="@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8"];
    lifetime_end [label="@llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8"];
    find_function [label="@_ZNKSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE4findEPKcmm"];
    
    // Variable Nodes
    vector_in_0 [label="%0: Input Vector"];
    vector_in_1 [label="%1: Input Vector"];
    string_in [label="%2: Input String"];
    local_var [label="%4: Local Variable (i64)"];
    
    // Operations
    load_operation [label="load"];
    comparison [label="icmp"];
    branch [label="br"];
    
    // Edges
    vector_in_0 -> load_operation;
    vector_in_1 -> load_operation;
    string_in -> load_operation;
    load_operation -> comparison;
    comparison -> branch;
    filter_by_substring -> lifetime_start;
    lifetime_start -> load_operation;
    lifetime_end -> branch;
    
    // Other edges for control flow and function calls
    filter_by_substring -> find_function;
}
```

In this DOT representation:
- Each node is labeled appropriately.
- Directed edges indicate the flow of data and control.
- This representation can be processed by graph visualization tools (like Graphviz) to produce a visual graph. 

You can run the above DOT code through Graphviz to generate a visual representation of the Data Flow Graph.
