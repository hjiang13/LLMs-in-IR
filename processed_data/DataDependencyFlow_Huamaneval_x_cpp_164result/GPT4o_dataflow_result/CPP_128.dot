### Visualization Suggestion
To visualize this data flow graph diagrammatically:
1. Use circles or ovals for nodes representing variables and operations.
2. Use directed arrows to represent edges indicating data dependencies and control flow.
3. Arrange the nodes to show the topological order, with the function entry at the top and the return at the bottom.
4. Group nodes belonging to the same basic block together to indicate their scope.
5. Use different colors or styles for nodes (e.g., function calls, comparisons, arithmetic operations) for clarity.

### Example DOT Format
Hereâ€™s an example of how the graph can be represented in DOT format:

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    Entry [label="_Z10prod_signsSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];
    Load1 [label="%3"];
    Load2 [label="%5"];
    PtrToInt1 [label="%6"];
    PtrToInt2 [label="%7"];
    Subtract [label="%8"];
    Compare1 [label="%9"];
    Block10 [label="10"];
    Shift [label="%11"];
    CallMax [label="@llvm.umax.i64"];
    ResultMax [label="%12"];
    And1 [label="%13"];
    Compare2 [label="%14"];
    Block15 [label="15"];
    And2 [label="%16"];
    LoopBlock [label="17"];
    // Further nodes...
    Return [label="%66"];

    // Edges
    Entry -> Load1;
    Entry -> Load2;
    Load1 -> PtrToInt1;
    Load2 -> PtrToInt2;
    PtrToInt1 -> Subtract;
    PtrToInt2 -> Subtract;
    Subtract -> Compare1;
    Compare1 -> Block10;
    Block10 -> Shift;
    Shift -> CallMax;
    CallMax -> ResultMax;
    ResultMax -> And1;
    And1 -> Compare2;
    Compare2 -> Block15;
    Block15 -> And2;
    // Further edges...
    And2 -> Return;
}
```
