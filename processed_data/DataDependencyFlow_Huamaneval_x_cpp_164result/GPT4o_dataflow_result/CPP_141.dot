To represent the data flow of the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code in a data flow graph using the DOT format, we will define a graph structure where nodes represent variables, operations, and function calls, while edges represent data dependencies between them.

### Data Flow Graph Overview

**Nodes:**
1. **Function Entry**: The start of the function `_Z15file_name_check`
2. **Allocations**: 
   - `alloca_basic_string`
   - `alloca_allocator`
3. **Load Operations**:
   - `load_string_length` (load from %1 to get the length of the string)
   - `load_character` (load character from string)
4. **Comparisons**: 
   - `icmp_length_check` (compare length with constant)
   - `icmp_character_check` (compare character with constants)
5. **Branches**:
   - `branch_length_ok`
   - `branch_character_check`
6. **Function Calls**:
   - `call_compare1` (compare with ".txt")
   - `call_compare2` (compare with ".exe")
   - `call_compare3` (compare with ".dll")
   - `call_allocate_string` (allocate new string)
7. **Stores**:
   - `store_result` (store the results based on conditions)
8. **Function Exit**: The end of the function (return void)

### Edges:
- Connect nodes based on the data flow and dependencies. For example:
  - From the function entry to allocation nodes, since the function begins by allocating memory.
  - From allocation nodes to load operations (loading values from the allocated memory).
  - From load operations to comparison nodes where the values are compared.
  - From comparison nodes to branch nodes indicating the flow of control based on the comparison results.
  - Connect branch nodes to the function calls based on the paths taken.
  - From function calls to store operations indicating where results are stored.
  - Finally, from store operations to the function exit, indicating that the function will complete after storing results.

### DOT Format Representation

Hereâ€™s how the above description can be translated into a DOT file format:

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    // Node definitions
    Entry [label="Function Entry"];
    AllocaStr [label="alloca_basic_string"];
    AllocaAlloc [label="alloca_allocator"];
    LoadLength [label="load_string_length"];
    IcLengthCheck [label="icmp_length_check"];
    BranchLengthOk [label="branch_length_ok"];
    LoadChar [label="load_character"];
    IcCharCheck [label="icmp_character_check"];
    BranchCharCheck [label="branch_character_check"];
    CallCompare1 [label="call_compare1"];
    CallCompare2 [label="call_compare2"];
    CallCompare3 [label="call_compare3"];
    CallAllocateStr [label="call_allocate_string"];
    StoreResult [label="store_result"];
    Exit [label="Function Exit"];

    // Edges representing data flow
    Entry -> AllocaStr;
    Entry -> AllocaAlloc;
    AllocaStr -> LoadLength;
    LoadLength -> IcLengthCheck;
    IcLengthCheck -> BranchLengthOk;
    AllocaStr -> LoadChar;
    LoadChar -> IcCharCheck;
    IcCharCheck -> BranchCharCheck;
    BranchLengthOk -> CallCompare1;
    BranchLengthOk -> CallCompare2;
    BranchLengthOk -> CallCompare3;
    BranchCharCheck -> CallAllocateStr;
    CallCompare1 -> StoreResult;
    CallCompare2 -> StoreResult;
    CallCompare3 -> StoreResult;
    CallAllocateStr -> StoreResult;
    StoreResult -> Exit;
}
```

### Visualization Suggestions

To visualize this in a diagrammatic form:
1. **Graph Visualization Tools**: Use tools like Graphviz to render the DOT file. For example, you can use the command `dot -Tpng -o output.png your_file.dot` to create a PNG image of the graph.
2. **Node Styles**: Differentiate nodes by color based on their types (e.g., allocations in one color, function calls in another).
3. **Edge Styles**: Use arrows to represent the direction of data flow. You might also consider labeling edges to clarify what data is being passed (e.g., variable names).
4. **Layout**: Ensure that the layout has a clear top-down or left-right flow to represent the order of operations visually.

This is a high-level representation of the data flow based on the provided IR code. Each node and edge describes how data moves and is manipulated throughout the function, allowing for a better understanding of dependencies and control flow in the program's execution.
