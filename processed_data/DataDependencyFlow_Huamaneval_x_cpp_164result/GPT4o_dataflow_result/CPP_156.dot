To generate a data flow graph from the given intermediate representation (IR) code, we will outline the key nodes and edges based on the flow of data through variables and operations. The nodes will represent variables, operations, and function calls, while the edges will indicate the dependencies between them.

### Nodes
1. **Function: `_Z18int_to_mini_romankB5cxx11i`**
   - This is the entry point of the function.

2. **Allocations:**
   - `%3`: Allocated i64
   - `%4`: Allocated `std::vector`
   - `%5`: Allocated array of `std::__cxx11::basic_string` (size 13)
   - `%6`: Allocated `std::__cxx11::basic_string`

3. **Variables:**
   - `%0`: Input argument of type `std::__cxx11::basic_string`
   - `%1`: Input argument of type i32
   - `%7`: GEP result for string data
   - `%8`: Bitcast to `union.anon**`
   - `%9`: Pointer to the string data (i8*)
   - `%11`, `%14`, `%17`, `%19`, `%21`, `%23`, `%26`, etc.: Various pointers and temporary variables used throughout the function.

4. **Function Calls:**
   - `@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8`: Called multiple times to indicate the start of lifetime for different allocations.
   - `@llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8`: Called to indicate the end of lifetime for allocated memory.
   - `@llvm.memset.p0i8.i64`: Memory initialization function.
   - `@llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64`: Memory copy function.
   - `@__cxa_begin_catch`: Exception handling function.
   - `@__cxa_end_catch`: Exception handling function.
   - `@__cxa_rethrow`: Exception rethrowing function.
   - `@_Znwm`: Memory allocation function.
   - `@_ZdlPv`: Memory deallocation function.

### Edges
- **Data Dependency Edges:**
  - From `%0` to `%7` indicating that the string's data is extracted from the input argument.
  - From `%7` to `%8` as the address of the string data is stored.
  - From `%8` to `%9` showing that the data is cast to `i8*`.
  - From `%11` to `%17`, `%19` indicating the storage of values into various pointers.
  - From `%4` to the various lifetime start and end calls, indicating the ownership of memory.
  - From `%5` to the memory copy operations, indicating source and destination pointers.

- **Control Flow Edges:**
  - From the function entry node to the various allocation nodes representing the initial setup of the function.
  - From the allocation nodes to the various operations that manipulate those allocated variables.
  - Edges from function calls to their return values, indicating where the results of these calls are used in further computations.
  - Conditional edges that determine the flow based on the results of comparisons (i.e., branches based on if conditions).

### Diagrammatic Representation
To visualize this graphically, you can use the DOT language which is compatible with Graphviz. Below is a simple representation of how the graph could be structured in DOT format:

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    // Function Node
    Function [label="_Z18int_to_mini_romankB5cxx11i"];
    
    // Allocation Nodes
    Alloc_i64 [label="%3"];
    Alloc_vector [label="%4"];
    Alloc_array [label="%5"];
    Alloc_string [label="%6"];
    
    // Input Nodes
    Input_string [label="%0"];
    Input_int [label="%1"];
    
    // GEP and Bitcast Nodes
    GEP_string_data [label="%7"];
    Bitcast_union [label="%8"];
    Pointer_data [label="%9"];
    
    // Function Calls
    Lifetime_start [label="@llvm.lifetime.start"];
    Lifetime_end [label="@llvm.lifetime.end"];
    Memset [label="@llvm.memset"];
    Memcpy [label="@llvm.memcpy"];
    
    // Control Flow Edges
    Function -> Alloc_i64;
    Function -> Alloc_vector;
    Function -> Alloc_array;
    Function -> Alloc_string;

    // Data Dependency Edges
    Input_string -> GEP_string_data;
    GEP_string_data -> Bitcast_union;
    Bitcast_union -> Pointer_data;
    Alloc_vector -> Lifetime_start;
    Alloc_array -> Memset;
    Alloc_string -> Lifetime_end;

    // Additional edges can be added as per the operations and flow in the function...
}
```

This DOT representation outlines the basic structure of the data flow graph, with nodes representing variables, operations, and function calls, and directed edges indicating data dependencies and control flow. You can use Graphviz tools to render this DOT representation into a visual graph.
