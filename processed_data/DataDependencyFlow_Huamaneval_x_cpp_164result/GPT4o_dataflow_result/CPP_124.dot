To create a data flow graph (DFG) for the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will identify the significant variables, operations, and control flow constructs, and represent them as nodes in the graph. Edges will illustrate the dependencies between these nodes.

### Nodes
1. **Function Entry**
   - `_Z10valid_date`

2. **Allocations**
   - `%2`: Allocated basic_string
   - `%3`: Allocated basic_string
   - `%4`: Allocated basic_string

3. **Load Operations & Comparisons**
   - `%5`: Load from input string
   - `%6`: Load length of string
   - `%7`: Compare length to 10
   - `%9`: Load character from string
   - `%11`: Load character as integer
   - `%12`: Adjust character by subtracting 48
   - `%13`: Compare adjusted character to 9

4. **Control Flow Nodes**
   - Branch: if `%7`
   - Branch: if `%13`
   - Exception Handling: Out of Range
   - Final Branching: Various cases leading to return

5. **Function Calls**
   - `@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8`
   - `@strtol`
   - `@llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64`
   - `@_ZdlPv`
   - `@llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8`
   - `@llvm.experimental.noalias.scope.decl`

6. **Return Value**
   - `%93`: Return statement

### Edges
- **Data Dependencies:**
  - `%0` → `%5`: Input string is accessed to derive `%5`
  - `%5` → `%6`: Length of string is loaded from `%5`
  - `%6` → `%7`: Length is compared to 10
  - `%9` → `%10`: Character at position `%9` is accessed
  - `%10` → `%11`: Character is loaded from address
  - `%11` → `%12`: Character is adjusted
  - `%12` → `%13`: Comparison to 9
  - `%13` → Branching to `%92` or `%94`
  - `%4` → `%36`: Allocation for output string
  - `%32` → `%33`: Length comparison and branching

- **Control Flow Dependencies:**
  - Various logical branches connect to each other based on comparisons and function calls, leading to the final return value.

### Dot File Representation
Here’s how the data flow graph can be represented in DOT format:

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    rankdir=LR;

    // Function Entry
    entry [label="_Z10valid_date" shape=circle];

    // Allocations
    alloc1 [label="%2: basic_string" shape=box];
    alloc2 [label="%3: basic_string" shape=box];
    alloc3 [label="%4: basic_string" shape=box];

    // Load Operations
    load5 [label="%5: Load from input string" shape=box];
    load6 [label="%6: Load length" shape=box];
    cmp7 [label="%7: Compare length" shape=diamond];
    load9 [label="%9: Load character" shape=box];
    load11 [label="%11: Load character as integer" shape=box];
    adjust12 [label="%12: Adjust character" shape=box];
    cmp13 [label="%13: Compare to 9" shape=diamond];

    // Function Calls
    callStrtol [label="@strtol" shape=box];
    callLifetimeStart [label="@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8" shape=box];
    callLifetimeEnd [label="@llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8" shape=box];

    // Return Value
    returnVal [label="%93: Return value" shape=circle];

    // Edges
    entry -> alloc1;
    entry -> alloc2;
    entry -> alloc3;
    entry -> load5;
    load5 -> load6;
    load6 -> cmp7;
    load9 -> load11;
    load11 -> adjust12;
    adjust12 -> cmp13;
    cmp7 -> load9 [label="true"];
    cmp13 -> returnVal [label="true"];
    callStrtol -> returnVal;
    
    // Control flow edges
    cmp7 -> alloc3 [label="false"];
    // Additional edges can be added to reflect all branching paths
}
```

### Visualization
To visualize this graphically:
1. Use graph visualization tools such as Graphviz.
2. Render the above DOT representation using `dot` or `neato` to create a visual representation.
3. The nodes can be represented as circles or boxes, with arrows indicating the flow of data and control.

This DFG captures the essential data dependencies and control flow of the IR code while omitting the intricate details of each basic block's content.
