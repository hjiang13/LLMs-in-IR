To create a data flow graph (DFG) from the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we will outline the key nodes (representing variables, operations, and function calls) and edges (indicating data dependencies). Here's a detailed description of how the DFG can be constructed:

### Nodes
The nodes in the DFG will represent the following elements in the code:

1. **Function Node**:
   - `_Z10sort_arraySt6vectorIiSaIiEE` (Function Entry)

2. **Basic Block Nodes**:
   - `%0` (Input Vector)
   - `%1` (Input Vector)
   - `%2` (Control Flow Start)
   - `%3` (Pointer Arithmetic)
   - `%4` (Pointer Arithmetic)
   - `%5` (Load from Vector)
   - `%6` (Load from Vector)
   - `%7` (Comparison)
   - `%8` (Branch)
   - `%9` (Comparison)
   - `%10` (Loop Start)
   - `%11` (Load Operation)
   - `%12` (Branch)
   - `%13` (Load Operations)
   - `%14` (Comparison)
   - `%21` (Load Operations)
   - `%22` (Store Operations)
   - `%26` (Comparison)
   - `%28` (Load Operations)
   - `%34` (Store Operations)
   - `%41` (Loop End)
   - `%45` (Loop Increment)
   - `%48` (Control Flow End)
   - `%49` (Pointer Handling)
   - `%131` (Function Exit)

3. **Variable Nodes**:
   - `%132` (Output Vector Pointer)
   - `%133` (Intermediate Variable)
   - `%134` (Intermediate Variable)
   - `%135` (Store Operations)
   - `%136` (Pointer Handling)
   - `%137` (Store Operations)
   - `%140` (Memory Initialization)
   - `%141` (Memory Check)
   - `%144` (Function Return)

### Edges
The edges will indicate the data flow between operations, defining dependencies:

1. **Function Entry to Basic Blocks**:
   - Edge from `_Z10sort_arraySt6vectorIiSaIiEE` to `%2`
   
2. **Control Flow**:
   - Edge from `%2` to `%3`
   - Edge from `%2` to `%4`
   - Edge from `%3` to `%5` (load operation)
   - Edge from `%4` to `%6` (load operation)
   - Edge from `%5` to `%7` (comparison)
   - Edge from `%6` to `%7` (comparison)
   - Edge from `%7` to `%8` (branching)
   - Edge from `%8` to `%9` (loop start)
   
3. **Loop Structure**:
   - Edge from `%9` to `%10` (loop body)
   - Edge from `%10` to `%11` (load operation)
   - Edge from `%11` to `%12` (branching)
   - Edge from `%12` to `%13` (load operations)
   - Edge from `%13` to `%14` (comparison)
   - Edge from `%14` to `%21` (load operations)
   - Edge from `%21` to `%22` (store operations)
   - Edge from `%22` to `%26` (comparison)
   - Edge from `%26` to `%28` (load operations)
   - Edge from `%28` to `%34` (store operations)
   - Edge from `%34` to `%41` (loop end)
   - Edge from `%41` to `%45` (increment loop)
   - Edge from `%45` to `%48` (exit)

4. **Function Exit**:
   - Edge from `%48` to `%131` (function exit)
   - Edge from `%131` to `%144` (return value)

### Visualization
To visualize this DFG, you can use the DOT language for graph representation. Here is a simplified example of how to represent it in DOT format:

```dot
digraph DFG {
    rankdir=LR; // Left to Right layout
    node [shape=box];

    // Function Node
    func [label="_Z10sort_arraySt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];

    // Basic Block Nodes
    block2 [label="%2"];
    block3 [label="%3"];
    block4 [label="%4"];
    block5 [label="%5"];
    block6 [label="%6"];
    block7 [label="%7"];
    block8 [label="%8"];
    block9 [label="%9"];
    block10 [label="%10"];
    block11 [label="%11"];
    block12 [label="%12"];
    block13 [label="%13"];
    block14 [label="%14"];
    block21 [label="%21"];
    block22 [label="%22"];
    block26 [label="%26"];
    block28 [label="%28"];
    block34 [label="%34"];
    block41 [label="%41"];
    block45 [label="%45"];
    block48 [label="%48"];
    block131 [label="%131"];
    block144 [label="%144"];

    // Edges
    func -> block2;
    block2 -> block3;
    block2 -> block4;
    block3 -> block5;
    block4 -> block6;
    block5 -> block7;
    block6 -> block7;
    block7 -> block8;
    block8 -> block9;
    block9 -> block10;
    block10 -> block11;
    block11 -> block12;
    block12 -> block13;
    block13 -> block14;
    block14 -> block21;
    block21 -> block22;
    block22 -> block26;
    block26 -> block28;
    block28 -> block34;
    block34 -> block41;
    block41 -> block45;
    block45 -> block48;
    block48 -> block131;
    block131 -> block144;
}
```

### Conclusion
This outline provides a comprehensive structure of the data flow graph for the provided IR code. You can visualize this graph using graph visualization tools such as Graphviz that support the DOT language. This will help in understanding the dependencies and flow of data through the operations in the code.
