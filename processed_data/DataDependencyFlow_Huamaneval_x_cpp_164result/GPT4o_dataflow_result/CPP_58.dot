To create a data flow graph from the given Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we need to identify the key nodes, which represent variables, operations, and function calls, and the edges, which represent the data dependencies between these nodes. Below is a structured description of the nodes and edges that would form the graph.

### Data Flow Graph Description

#### Nodes:
1. **Function Entry**: `@_Z6commonSt6vectorIiSaIiEES1_`
2. **Variables**:
   - `%0`: Output vector
   - `%1`: Input vector 1
   - `%2`: Input vector 2
   - `%4`: Element pointer of vector 1
   - `%5`: Element pointer of vector 1
   - `%6`: Element pointer of output vector
   - `%7`: Element pointer of output vector
   - `%8`: Element pointer of input vector 2
   - `%9`: Element pointer of input vector 2
   - `%10`: Element pointer of output vector
   - `%12`: Loaded pointer from `%4`
   - `%13`: Loaded pointer from `%5`
   - `%14`: Comparison result
   - `%15`: Branch to labels
   - `%16` to `%100`: Various intermediate results and operations
   - `%101`: Loaded input vector 1
   - `%102`: Loaded input vector 2
   - `%103`: Pointer manipulation results
   - `%104`: Comparison results with branches
   - `%105`: Loaded values from various pointers
   - `%106`: Final comparison results leading to termination.
  
3. **Function Calls**:
   - `@llvm.memset.p0i8.i64`
   - `@llvm.ctlz.i64`
   - `@_ZSt16__introsort_loopIN9__gnu_cxx17__normal_iteratorIPiSt6vectorIiSaIiEEEElNS0_5__ops15_Iter_less_iterEEvT_S9_T0_T1_`
   - `@_ZSt22__final_insertion_sortIN9__gnu_cxx17__normal_iteratorIPiSt6vectorIiSaIiEEEENS0_5__ops15_Iter_less_iterEEvT_S9_T0_`
   - Additional helper functions for memory management and error handling.

#### Edges:
- Edges represent the data flow and dependencies between nodes:
   - From **Function Entry** to `%0`, `%1`, `%2`: Function parameters flow into the function.
   - From `%1` to `%4`, `%5`: Element pointers derived from the first input vector.
   - From `%2` to `%8`, `%9`: Element pointers derived from the second input vector.
   - From `%0` to `%6`, `%7`: Element pointers derived from the output vector.
   - From `%12` and `%13` to `%14`: Loaded values are compared.
   - From `%14` to `%15`: Conditional branching based on comparison.
   - From `%15` to various intermediate computations (`%16` to `%100`) representing the control flow and data manipulation.
   - From `%101` and `%102` to subsequent function calls, indicating that their outputs are utilized in the invoked functions.
   - From each function call back to the original function, indicating how results are integrated into the main flow.
   - Final results from comparisons and loads lead back to the function exit.

### Visualization
The data flow graph can be visualized diagrammatically as follows:
- Use circles or ovals to represent nodes (variables and operations).
- Use directed arrows to represent edges, showing the flow of data.
- Group nodes belonging to function calls visually together to indicate their relationship.
- Use different colors or shapes to differentiate between types of nodes (e.g., variable nodes vs. operation nodes).

### Example DOT Format
Hereâ€™s a simple representation of how the DOT format might look for our graph:

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    rankdir=LR;
    Entry [label="Function Entry: @_Z6commonSt6vectorIiSaIiEES1_"];
    
    // Variables
    output_vector [label="%0: Output Vector"];
    input_vector_1 [label="%1: Input Vector 1"];
    input_vector_2 [label="%2: Input Vector 2"];
    
    // Function calls
    introsort [label="Function Call: @_ZSt16__introsort_loop..."];
    insertion_sort [label="Function Call: @_ZSt22__final_insertion_sort..."];
    
    // Connect nodes
    Entry -> output_vector;
    Entry -> input_vector_1;
    Entry -> input_vector_2;
    
    // Additional connections
    input_vector_1 -> introsort;
    input_vector_2 -> insertion_sort;
    output_vector -> introsort;
    output_vector -> insertion_sort;

    // More connections can be added based on further analysis of the IR
}
```

This representation provides a clear and structured understanding of how data flows through the IR code, highlighting key operations and their dependencies.
