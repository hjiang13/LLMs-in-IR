To create a data flow graph from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will outline the nodes and edges based on the variables, function calls, and control flow structures present in the code. We will focus on the main operations and their dependencies without delving into the specifics of each basic block.

### Data Flow Graph Representation

**Nodes:**
1. **Function Entry**: Entry point of the function `_Z15sorted_list_sumSt6vector...`.
2. **Allocations**: 
   - `alloca i64` (local variable for storing a 64-bit integer)
   - `alloca %class.std::__cxx11::basic_string` (local variable for string)
3. **Load Operations**:
   - Load operations for accessing elements from the vectors (`%5`, `%6`, etc.)
4. **Control Flow Decisions**:
   - `icmp eq` comparisons (e.g., comparing string pointers)
   - `br` statements indicating branches based on conditions
5. **Function Calls**:
   - Calls to various functions (e.g., `@llvm.memset`, `@llvm.lifetime.start`, `@llvm.lifetime.end`)
   - Calls to custom functions like `_ZSt16__insertion_sort...`, `_ZSt11__make_heap...`, etc.
6. **Data Store Operations**:
   - Store operations for saving values into the variables and vectors.
7. **Function Exit**: Exit point of the function with the return statement.

**Edges:**
- **Data Dependencies**: Arrows from nodes that produce data (e.g., stores) to nodes that consume that data (e.g., loads).
- **Control Flow**: Arrows indicating the flow of execution based on branch conditions (e.g., from `icmp eq` nodes to their respective `br` targets).
- **Function Calls**: Arrows from the point of function calls to the respective function nodes, indicating a call to another operation (like sorting or memory allocation).

### Example Nodes and Edges Description

- **Node A**: Entry Point of Function (`_Z15sorted_list_sum...`)
  - **Edges**: 
    - to Node B (alloca for `i64`)
    - to Node C (alloca for `basic_string`)

- **Node B**: Alloca for `i64`
  - **Edges**:
    - to Node D (load from vector `%5`)
  
- **Node C**: Alloca for `basic_string`
  - **Edges**:
    - to Node E (load from vector `%6`)

- **Node D**: Load operation (`%5`)
  - **Edges**:
    - to Node F (comparison `icmp eq`)
  
- **Node E**: Load operation (`%6`)
  - **Edges**:
    - to Node F (as part of the same comparison)
  
- **Node F**: Comparison (`icmp eq`)
  - **Edges**:
    - to Node G (conditional branch based on comparison)
  
- **Node G**: Conditional Branch (`br i1`)
  - **Edges**:
    - to Node H (true branch)
    - to Node I (false branch)
  
- **Node H**: True branch processing (could call sorting functions)
  - **Edges**:
    - to Node J (function call to sorting)
  
- **Node I**: False branch processing
  - **Edges**:
    - back to Node D or other nodes as needed
  
- **Node J**: Function call to sort or manipulate string
  - **Edges**:
    - to Node K (return to previous context)
  
- **Node K**: Function Exit
  - **Edges**:
    - back to function caller or return to the main program

### Diagrammatic Visualization

To visualize the above data flow graph:

1. **Nodes** can be represented as circles or rectangles labeled with their respective identifiers (e.g., "Function Entry", "Alloca i64", "Load from Vector", etc.).
2. **Edges** can be represented as directed arrows connecting the nodes, indicating the flow of data and control between them.
3. **Subgraphs** can be used to group related nodes (e.g., all sorting-related function calls can be in one subgraph).
4. **Color Coding** can be applied to differentiate between variable declarations, control flow nodes, and function calls for better clarity.

The visualization can be created using tools like Graphviz (using DOT language) or other graphical modeling tools that support directed graphs. 

### Example DOT Format

Here's a simplified example of how the graph might look in DOT format:

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    FunctionEntry [label="Function Entry"];
    AllocaInt [label="Alloca i64"];
    AllocaString [label="Alloca String"];
    Load1 [label="Load from Vector %5"];
    Load2 [label="Load from Vector %6"];
    Compare [label="icmp eq"];
    Branch [label="Conditional Branch"];
    TrueBranch [label="True Branch"];
    FalseBranch [label="False Branch"];
    SortCall [label="Sort Function Call"];
    FunctionExit [label="Function Exit"];

    // Define edges
    FunctionEntry -> AllocaInt;
    FunctionEntry -> AllocaString;
    AllocaInt -> Load1;
    AllocaString -> Load2;
    Load1 -> Compare;
    Load2 -> Compare;
    Compare -> Branch;
    Branch -> TrueBranch;
    Branch -> FalseBranch;
    TrueBranch -> SortCall;
    SortCall -> FunctionExit;
    FalseBranch -> FunctionExit;
}
```

This representation provides a high-level view of the data flow within the code, allowing for easier analysis of variable dependencies and control flow.
