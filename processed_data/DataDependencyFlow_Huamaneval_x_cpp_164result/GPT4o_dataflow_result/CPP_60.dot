To create a data flow graph from the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we need to identify the variables, operations, and control flow. The code defines a single function, `sum_to_n`, which performs several arithmetic operations. 

### Nodes and Edges Description

#### Nodes:
1. **Function: sum_to_n**
   - Represents the entry point of the function.

2. **Input Variable: %0**
   - Represents the input parameter to the function.

3. **Operation: %2 = add nsw i32 %0, 1**
   - Represents the addition operation, which adds 1 to the input variable `%0`.

4. **Operation: %3 = mul nsw i32 %2, %0**
   - Represents the multiplication operation, which multiplies the result of `%2` by the input variable `%0`.

5. **Operation: %4 = sdiv i32 %3, 2**
   - Represents the division operation, which divides the result of `%3` by 2.

6. **Return Value: ret i32 %4**
   - Represents the return statement of the function, which outputs the final result `%4`.

#### Edges:
1. **Edge from sum_to_n to %0**
   - Indicates that the function takes `%0` as an input.

2. **Edge from %0 to %2**
   - Indicates that the value of `%0` is used in the addition operation to compute `%2`.

3. **Edge from %2 to %3**
   - Indicates that the value of `%2` is used in the multiplication operation to compute `%3`.

4. **Edge from %0 to %3**
   - Indicates that the value of `%0` is also used in the multiplication operation to compute `%3`.

5. **Edge from %3 to %4**
   - Indicates that the value of `%3` is used in the division operation to compute `%4`.

6. **Edge from %4 to return**
   - Indicates that the value of `%4` is returned from the function.

### Dot File Representation

Hereâ€™s how the data flow graph can be represented in the DOT format:

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    rankdir=LR;

    // Nodes
    sum_to_n [label="Function: sum_to_n"]
    input_var [label="%0"]
    add_op [label="%2 = add nsw i32 %0, 1"]
    mul_op [label="%3 = mul nsw i32 %2, %0"]
    div_op [label="%4 = sdiv i32 %3, 2"]
    return_val [label="ret i32 %4"]

    // Edges
    sum_to_n -> input_var
    input_var -> add_op
    input_var -> mul_op
    add_op -> mul_op
    mul_op -> div_op
    div_op -> return_val
}
```

### Visualization Suggestions
1. **Graph Layout**: The graph can be visualized using tools that support DOT files, such as Graphviz. The `rankdir=LR` attribute specifies that the graph should be laid out from left to right.

2. **Node Colors**: Different colors can be used to differentiate between types of nodes (e.g., input variables, operations, return values).

3. **Edge Styles**: Solid lines can represent direct data dependencies, while dashed lines could indicate potential indirect dependencies (if any).

4. **Labels and Tooltips**: Additional information can be included in tooltips or labels to provide context about each operation or variable.

By following this outline, you can create a detailed and informative data flow graph that highlights the dependencies and flow of data in the provided IR code.
