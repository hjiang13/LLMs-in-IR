To create a data flow graph from the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we will identify the key variables, operations, and control flow structures. The graph will consist of nodes representing variables and operations, and directed edges indicating data flow and dependencies between them.

### Nodes
1. **Function Entry**: `_Z5solveNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`
2. **Allocations**:
    - `%3`: `alloca i64`
    - `%4`: `alloca i64`
    - `%5`: `alloca basic_string`
    - `%6`: `alloca basic_string`
3. **Lifetime Operations**:
    - `@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8` (for `%5`, `%6`, and others)
    - `@llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8`
4. **GetElementPointer Operations**:
    - `%8`: `getelementptr basic_string`
    - `%13`: `getelementptr basic_string from %1`
    - `%16`: `getelementptr basic_string`
5. **Loads**:
    - `%24`: `load i64 from %13`
    - `%37`: `load i8* from %14`
    - `%55`: `load i64 from %12`
    - `%67`: `load i64 from %22`
6. **Stores**:
    - `%10`: `store i8*`
    - `%18`: `store i64`
    - `%19`: `store i8*`
7. **Control Flow**:
    - `%25`: `icmp eq`
    - `%30`: `phi i32`
    - `%31`: `phi i64`
    - `%62`: `phi i8*`
8. **Calls**:
    - `@llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64`
    - `@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8`
    - `@llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8`
    - `_ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE9_M_createERmm`
    - `_ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE14_M_replace_auxEmmmc`
9. **Function Return**: `ret void`

### Edges
- **Data dependencies between allocations and operations**:
    - `%3` is used in `store` instructions.
    - `%4` is read in `load` and `store` operations.
    - `%5` and `%6` are involved in multiple `getelementptr`, `load`, and `store` operations.
    - `%1` is passed to various operations that mutate or read the state of the string.
- **Control flow edges**:
    - Conditional branches that lead to different basic blocks, indicated by `br` instructions.
    - The `%30` and `%31` `phi` nodes are used to combine values from different control flow paths.
- **Function call edges**:
    - Each call to a function represents a data dependency on inputs and outputs. For example, the output of `_ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE9_M_createERmm` is stored in an appropriately typed variable.

### Visualization Suggestions
The data flow graph can be visually represented as follows:
- **Nodes**: Represent each unique variable or operation as a circle or rectangle, labeled with its identifier (e.g., `%3`, `%4`, `@llvm.lifetime.start`).
- **Edges**: Draw directed arrows from nodes that produce data to nodes that consume data, indicating the flow of information.
- **Grouping**: Consider grouping nodes by their functional roles (e.g., allocations, loads, stores, control flow) using different colors or shapes for clarity.
- **Control Flow Structure**: Use dashed lines to represent edges that indicate control flow (e.g., branches), while solid lines can represent data dependencies.

### Example Dot File Structure
```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    node [shape=box];
    
    entry [label="_Z5solveNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE"];
    alloc3 [label="%3: alloca i64"];
    alloc4 [label="%4: alloca i64"];
    alloc5 [label="%5: alloca basic_string"];
    alloc6 [label="%6: alloca basic_string"];
    
    // Representing lifetime operations
    lifetime_start [label="llvm.lifetime.start"];
    lifetime_end [label="llvm.lifetime.end"];
    
    // Operations and loads/stores
    load24 [label="%24: load i64 from %13"];
    store10 [label="%10: store i8*"];
    
    // Control flow
    phi30 [label="%30: phi i32"];
    phi31 [label="%31: phi i64"];
    
    // Function calls
    create_call [label="_ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE9_M_createERmm"];
    
    // Relationships
    entry -> alloc3;
    entry -> alloc4;
    entry -> alloc5;
    entry -> alloc6;
    
    alloc3 -> load24;
    alloc4 -> store10;
    alloc5 -> lifetime_start;
    alloc6 -> lifetime_end;
    
    // Control flows
    phi30 -> load24;
    phi31 -> create_call;
    
    // Additional edges can be added here...
}
```

With this structure, you can generate a visual representation of the data flow graph using tools that can process DOT files, like Graphviz. Each node and edge can be expanded or refined based on further analysis of the underlying IR code.
