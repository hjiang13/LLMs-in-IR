To represent the data flow graph (DFG) based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we'll identify the key variables, operations, and control flow constructs, and then outline the nodes and edges that illustrate the dependencies among them. Below is a detailed text description of the nodes and edges, followed by a suggested dot file format for visualization.

### Nodes:

   - Node 25: `%9` (Equality comparison)
   - Node 26: `%16` (Unsigned less than comparison)
   - Node 27: `%65` (Equality comparison)
   - Node 28: `%69` (Equality comparison)

5. **Select Operations:**
   - Node 29: `%60` (Select based on comparison)

   - Node 36: `%73` (Phi node for loop)

7. **Function Calls:**
   - Node 37: `@llvm.vector.reduce.add.v4i32` (Function call)
   - Node 38: `@llvm.umax.i64` (Function call)

8. **Return Variable:**
   - Node 39: `%75` (Return value)

### Edges:
- An edge from Node 0 to Nodes 1 and 2 (loading from vector).
- Edges connecting load operations (Nodes 1, 2) to arithmetic and comparison nodes (Nodes 8, 12, 14, 15, etc.).
- Edges connecting arithmetic nodes to phi nodes (Nodes 31, 32, 33 - representing values across loop iterations).
- Edges connecting comparison nodes to control flow (branches) and select operations (Nodes 29, 30).
- Edges from function call nodes (Nodes 37, 38) leading to subsequent operations.
- Edges leading to the return node (Node 39) from the final computations.

### Dot File Format
Below is a sample representation of the data flow graph in dot format:

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    rankdir=TB;

    // Input
    node [shape=box];
    input [label="%0 (Input Vector)"];
    
    // Load operations
    load1 [label="%3 (Load)"];
    load2 [label="%5 (Load)"];
    load3 [label="%40 (Load)"];
    load4 [label="%41 (Load)"];
    load5 [label="%42 (Load)"];
    load6 [label="%43 (Load)"];
    load7 [label="%48 (Load)"];
    load8 [label="%49 (Load)"];
    load9 [label="%50 (Load)"];
    load10 [label="%51 (Load)"];

    // Arithmetic operations
    sub [label="%8 (Subtraction)"];
    max [label="%12 (Call to llvm.umax)"];
    add [label="%14 (Addition)"];
    and [label="%15 (Bitwise AND)"];
    shl [label="%19 (Shift Left)"];
    shr [label="%13 (Shift Right)"];
    
    // Comparison operations
    eq1 [label="%9 (Equality Check)"];
    ult [label="%16 (Unsigned Less Than)"];

    // Phi Nodes
    phi1 [label="%21 (Phi Node)"];
    phi2 [label="%22 (Phi Node)"];
    phi3 [label="%23 (Phi Node)"];

    // Function Calls
    func1 [label="@llvm.vector.reduce.add.v4i32"];
    func2 [label="@llvm.umax.i64"];

    // Return
    ret [label="%75 (Return Value)"];

    // Edges
    input -> load1;
    input -> load2;
    load1 -> sub;
    load2 -> max;
    sub -> eq1;
    max -> add;
    eq1 -> ult;
    ult -> phi1;
    phi1 -> ret;
    
    // Additional edges to be defined based on the complete flow
}
```

### Visualization
To visualize this diagrammatically:
- You can use graph visualization tools like Graphviz, which can render the dot file into a flowchart.
- The layout can be arranged from top to bottom (rankdir=TB) to represent the flow of computation, with nodes representing operations and variables, and directed edges indicating data dependencies.
- Utilize different shapes or colors for nodes to distinguish between types (e.g., input, load, arithmetic, comparison, function calls, etc.).

This representation effectively captures the flow of data through the IR code and highlights dependencies between different variables and operations.
