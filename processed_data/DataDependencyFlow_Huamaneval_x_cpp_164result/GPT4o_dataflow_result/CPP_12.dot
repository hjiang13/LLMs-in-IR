Certainly! Let's break down the provided IR code and create a data flow graph based on its structure. The graph will focus on key nodes, such as variables, operations, and control flow structures, as well as the dependencies between them.

### Nodes
The nodes in the data flow graph can be categorized into the following types:

1. **Function Nodes**:
   - `@_Z7longestSt6vector`: Entry point of the function.

2. **Basic Block Nodes**:
   - `%2`: Entry Point Basic Block.
   - `%12`: Basic Block for comparison and branching.
   - `%20`: Basic Block for handling greater than comparison.
   - `%22`: Basic Block after invoking assignment.
   - `%25`: Landing pad for exception handling.
   - `%30`: Basic Block for memory deallocation.
   - `%32`: Block for post-conditional checks.
   - `%41`: Block for loading values.
   - `%43`: Exit Basic Block.

3. **Variable Nodes**:
   - `%0`: Output string (result).
   - `%1`: Input vector.
   - `%3` to `%10`: Temporary variables for string manipulation and comparison.
   - `%11`: Result of the integer comparison.
   - `%13` to `%17`: Temporary variables related to phi nodes and string element access.
   - `%18`: Loaded integer value.
   - `%19`: Result of unsigned greater than comparison.
   - `%21`: GEP for string assignment.
   - `%23` to `%24`: Loaded string values from vector.
   - `%26`: Landing pad result.
   - `%27` to `%29`: Temporary variables for exception handling.
   - `%33` to `%40`: Variables for loop and conditional calculations.
   - `%42`: Loaded integer value for comparison.

### Edges
The edges represent the data flow and dependencies between nodes. Here are some identified edges:

- **Function to Basic Block**:
  - `@_Z7longestSt6vector` → `%2`

- **Basic Block Control Flow**:
  - `%2` → `%12` (initial comparison)
  - `%12` → `%20` (if true)
  - `%12` → `%41` (if false)
  - `%20` → `%22` (after assignment)
  - `%22` → `%32` (continue after assignment)
  - `%20` → `%25` (exception handling)
  - `%25` → `%30` (deallocation)
  - `%25` → `%31` (resume after handling)
  - `%32` → `%41` (loop back)
  - `%32` → `%43` (exit condition)

- **Variable Dependencies**:
  - `%0` (result) is written by `store` operations in `%20` and read in `%22`.
  - `%1` is read in `%7` and `%8` to access the vector elements.
  - `%3` is stored and read to process string data in `%12` and `%20`.
  - `%9` and `%10` are loaded from the vector and are used for comparisons.
  - `%13`, `%14`, `%15`, `%16`, `%33`, and `%34` are phi node variables that depend on previous block outputs.
  - `%18` is derived from `%17` and influences conditional branching.

### Visualization
To visualize this data flow graph diagrammatically, you can use the DOT format. Below is a simple representation of how the graph could be structured in DOT format:

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    rankdir=LR;

    // Function Node
    node [shape=box];
    func [label="Function: @_Z7longestSt6vector"];
    entry [label="%2: Entry"];
    
    // Basic Block Nodes
    block1 [label="%12: Comparison"];
    block2 [label="%20: Greater Check"];
    block3 [label="%22: After Assignment"];
    block4 [label="%25: Landing Pad"];
    block5 [label="%30: Deallocate"];
    block6 [label="%32: Loop Check"];
    block7 [label="%41: Load Value"];
    exit [label="%43: Exit"];

    // Variable Nodes
    var0 [label="%0: Output"];
    var1 [label="%1: Input Vector"];
    var3 [label="%3: Temp Var"];
    var9 [label="%9: Load from Vector"];
    var10 [label="%10: Load from Vector"];
    
    // Edges
    func -> entry;
    entry -> block1;
    block1 -> block2 [label="if true"];
    block1 -> block7 [label="if false"];
    block2 -> block3;
    block2 -> block4;
    block3 -> block6;
    block4 -> block5;
    block5 -> block6;
    block6 -> block1 [label="loop back"];
    block6 -> exit [label="exit"];
    
    // Variable Dependencies
    var0 -> block3;
    var1 -> block1;
    var3 -> block1;
    var9 -> block1;
    var10 -> block1;
}
```

### Conclusion
This representation captures the essential data flow of the provided IR code, highlighting the relationships and dependencies among various components. You can use visualization tools, such as Graphviz, to render the DOT representation into a graphical format. This will help in analyzing the data flow and understanding the control structures better.
