To represent the data flow graph from the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we will identify key variables, operations, and control flow aspects. The graph will consist of nodes representing each significant element (variables, operations, functions) and directed edges that indicate the flow of data between them.

### Nodes:
1. **Function Entry**: `_Z14how_many_timesNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEES4_`
2. **Variables**:
   - `%0`: Input parameter (string)
   - `%1`: Input parameter (string)
   - `%3`: Local variable for result (i64)
   - `%4`: Local variable (string)
   - `%5`: GEP (getelementptr) operation on `%0`
   - `%6`: Load operation from `%5`
   - `%9`: GEP operation on `%1`
   - `%10`: `bitcast` operation
   - `%11`: GEP operation on `%4`
   - `%12`: `bitcast` operation
   - `%19`: GEP operation on `%1`
   - `%22`: `phi` operation
   - `%28`: `and` operation
   - `%30`: Load operation
   - `%31`: GEP operation
   - `%32`: `sub` operation
   - `%33`: `icmp` operation
   - `%34`: `select` operation
   - `%37`: Call operation to `_ZNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE9_M_createERmm`
   - `%40`: `phi` operation
   - `%45`: Load operation
   - `%48`: Load operation
   - `%50`: `icmp` operation
   - `%52`: `icmp` operation
   - `%54`: Load operation
   - `%59`: `phi` operation
   - `%66`: `zext` operation
   - `%67`: `add` operation
   - `%70`: `sub` operation
   - `%71`: `icmp` operation
   - `%73`: Return value (i32)

3. **Function Calls**:
   - `@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8`
   - `@llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8`
   - `@llvm.experimental.noalias.scope.decl`
   - `_ZSt24__throw_out_of_range_fmtPKcz`
   - `@llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64`
   - `@bcmp`

### Edges:
- From **Function Entry** to **%0**, **%1**: Input parameters are received upon function entry.
- From **%0** to **%5**: `getelementptr` operation is performed on `%0`.
- From **%5** to **%6**: Loading data from `%5`.
- From **%6** to **%7**: Used in `icmp` operation to check if it equals zero.
- From **%1** to **%9**: `getelementptr` operation on `%1`.
- From **%4** to **%11**: `getelementptr` operation on `%4`.
- From **%3** to **%15**: Stores the result of the `select` operation into `%3`.
- From **%22** to **%27**: The `icmp` result affects control flow.
- From **%34** to **%37**: Call to create a new string if certain conditions are met.
- From **%40** to **%41**, **%43**: Control flow based on conditions.
- From **%44** to **%45**: Control flow continues to load operation.
- From **%70** to **%71**: Comparison that influences flow.

### Data Flow Graph Representation in DOT Format:
Here's a simplified version of how the data flow graph could be represented in DOT format:

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    rankdir=TB;

    // Nodes
    FunctionEntry [label="_Z14how_many_timesNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEES4_"];
    InputParam0 [label="%0"];
    InputParam1 [label="%1"];
    LocalVar3 [label="%3"];
    LocalVar4 [label="%4"];
    GEP0 [label="%5"];
    Load1 [label="%6"];
    GEP1 [label="%9"];
    Call1 [label="@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8"];
    Call2 [label="@bcmp"];
    RetVal [label="%73"];

    // Edges
    FunctionEntry -> InputParam0;
    FunctionEntry -> InputParam1;
    InputParam0 -> GEP0;
    GEP0 -> Load1;
    Load1 -> LocalVar3;
    InputParam1 -> GEP1;
    LocalVar4 -> GEP1;
    LocalVar3 -> Call1;
    Call1 -> RetVal;
    Load1 -> Call2;
}
```

### Visualization:
To visualize this graph:
1. Use a tool that can render DOT files (e.g., Graphviz).
2. The nodes can be represented as circles or rectangles with labels, while edges will be directed arrows illustrating the data dependencies and flow.
3. Group nodes related to operations (like function calls) visually, which can help in understanding the control flow and dependencies.

### Conclusion
This representation captures the data flow through the provided IR code, emphasizing the dependencies and operations. You can extend this basic structure to include all nodes and edges by following the same pattern of node definitions and connections in the DOT format.
