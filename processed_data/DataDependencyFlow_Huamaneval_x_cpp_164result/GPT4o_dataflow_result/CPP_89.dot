To create a data flow graph (DFG) from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will focus on the main variables and operations involved, capturing data dependencies and control flow without diving into the specifics of each instruction.

### Nodes in the Data Flow Graph

1. **Function Entry**: `@_Z7encryptNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`
2. **Input Parameter**: `%0`, `%1` (input strings)
3. **Allocations**: 
   - `%3`: Alloca for `i64`
   - `%4`: Alloca for `std::__cxx11::basic_string`
4. **String Operations**:
   - `%5`: Pointer to the internal structure of the first string
   - `%9`: Pointer to the length of the second string
   - `%10`: Pointer to the internal character data of the second string
   - `%12`: Pointer to the internal structure of the created string
   - `%18`: Pointer to character data of the new string
5. **Condition Checks**:
   - `%21`: Load length of second string
   - `%22`: Check if length is zero (conditional branch)
6. **Control Flow**:
   - `%24`: Branch to handle empty string
   - `%26`: Loop entry
   - `%39`: Invoke memory creation function
   - `%41`: Handle successful memory allocation
   - `%43`: Join point for data flow after condition handling
   - `%45`, `%47`: Conditional branches for handling string manipulations
   - `%48`: Final handling before returning
7. **Function Exit**: `ret void`

### Edges in the Data Flow Graph

- **Input to Allocations**: 
  - `%0` and `%1` → `%3`, `%4` (input parameters lead to local storage)
- **Allocations to String Operations**: 
  - `%3` → `%21`, `%22` (allocation for string length)
  - `%4` → `%5`, `%12` (allocation for the new string structure)
- **Condition Check to Control Flow**:
  - `%21` → `%22` (length check leads to branch)
  - `%22` → `%24`, `%26` (conditional branching based on string length)
- **Loop and Memory Operations**:
  - `%26` → `%39` (loop entry to memory allocation)
  - `%39` → `%41` (successful allocation leads to handling)
  - `%41` → `%43` (join point after allocation)
- **String Manipulation Control Flow**:
  - `%43` → `%45`, `%47` (branching based on string length)
  - `%45` → `%48` (handling single character case)
  - `%47` → `%48` (handling memory copy)
- **Final Handling to Exit**:
  - `%48` → `Function Exit` (prepares for return)

### Visualization Suggestion

To visualize this data flow graph, you can use the DOT language (Graphviz) as follows:

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    node [shape=box];

    Entry [label="@_Z7encryptNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE"];
    Input0 [label="%0"];
    Input1 [label="%1"];
    Alloc3 [label="%3"];
    Alloc4 [label="%4"];
    StrOp5 [label="%5"];
    StrOp9 [label="%9"];
    StrOp10 [label="%10"];
    StrOp12 [label="%12"];
    Cond21 [label="%21"];
    Cond22 [label="%22"];
    Branch24 [label="%24"];
    LoopEntry26 [label="%26"];
    Invoke39 [label="%39"];
    Handle41 [label="%41"];
    Join43 [label="%43"];
    Branch45 [label="%45"];
    Branch47 [label="%47"];
    Final48 [label="%48"];
    Exit [label="ret void"];

    Entry -> Input0;
    Entry -> Input1;
    Input0 -> Alloc3;
    Input1 -> Alloc4;
    Alloc3 -> Cond21;
    Alloc4 -> StrOp5;
    Alloc4 -> StrOp12;
    Cond21 -> Cond22;
    Cond22 -> Branch24;
    Cond22 -> LoopEntry26;
    LoopEntry26 -> Invoke39;
    Invoke39 -> Handle41;
    Handle41 -> Join43;
    Join43 -> Branch45;
    Join43 -> Branch47;
    Branch45 -> Final48;
    Branch47 -> Final48;
    Final48 -> Exit;
}
```

### Summary

This representation captures the essential flow of data through the IR code, highlighting the key variables, operations, and control structures involved in the function. You can visualize this graph using tools that accept DOT format, such as Graphviz, to create a clear graphical representation of the data flow.
