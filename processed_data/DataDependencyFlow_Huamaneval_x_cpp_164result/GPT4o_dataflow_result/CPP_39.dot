To generate a data flow graph from the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we will identify the key variables, operations, and control flow structures. Each node in the graph will represent a significant variable or operation, while the edges will indicate the dependencies between them.

### Nodes in the Data Flow Graph

1. **Function Entry**: `_Z9prime_fibi(i32 %0)` - The entry point of the function.
2. **Basic Block 2**: 
    - **`%3`**: `phi` operation (from `%1` and `%19`)
    - **`%4`**: `phi` operation (from `%1` and `%19`)
    - **`%5`**: `phi` operation (from `%1` and `%19`)
    - **`%6`**: `icmp slt i32 %5, %0` - Comparison operation.
    - **`@llvm.assume`**: Function call based on the result of `%6`.
    - **`%7`**: `add nsw i32 %4, %3` - Addition operation.
    - **`%8`**: `icmp slt i32 %4, 4` - Comparison for control flow.
3. **Basic Block 9**: 
    - **`%10`**: `phi` operation (from `%2` and `%9`)
    - **`%11`**: `srem i32 %4, %10` - Remainder operation.
    - **`%12`**: `icmp eq i32 %11, 0` - Comparison operation.
    - **`%13`**: `add nuw nsw i32 %10, 1` - Increment operation.
    - **`%14`**: `mul nsw i32 %13, %13` - Multiplication operation.
    - **`%15`**: `icmp sgt i32 %14, %4` - Comparison operation.
    - **`%16`**: `select` operation based on `%12` and `%15`.
4. **Basic Block 17**: 
    - **`%18`**: `xor i1 %12, true` - XOR operation.
5. **Basic Block 19**: 
    - **`%20`**: `phi i1 [ true, %2 ], [ %18, %17 ]` - Conditional assignment.
    - **`%21`**: `zext i1 %20 to i32` - Zero extension.
    - **`%22`**: `add nuw nsw i32 %5, %21` - Addition operation.
    - **`%23`**: `icmp eq i32 %22, %0` - Comparison operation.
6. **Basic Block 24**: 
    - **Return Value**: `ret i32 %4` - Return statement.

### Edges in the Data Flow Graph

- **Control Flow Edges**:
    - From **Function Entry** to **Basic Block 2**.
    - From **Basic Block 2** to **Basic Block 9** (if condition `%8` is true) and back to **Basic Block 2** (if `%23` is false).
    - From **Basic Block 9** to **Basic Block 17** (if `%16` is true) and back to **Basic Block 9** (if false).
    - From **Basic Block 17** back to **Basic Block 19**.
    - From **Basic Block 19** to **Basic Block 24** (if `%23` is true) and back to **Basic Block 2** (if false).

- **Data Dependency Edges**:
    - `%3`, `%4`, `%5` are inputs to `%6`, `%7`, and `%8`.
    - `%10` feeds into `%11`, `%12`, and `%13`.
    - `%13` feeds into `%14`.
    - `%12`, `%15` feed into `%16`.
    - `%20` is derived from `%2` and `%18`.
    - `%21` is derived from `%20`.
    - `%22` is derived from `%5` and `%21`.
    - `%23` is derived from `%22` and `%0`.

}

### Visualization Suggestions

To visualize the graph:
- Use tools like Graphviz to render the `.dot` file into a graphical representation.
- Each variable and operation can be represented as nodes, with directed edges illustrating the flow of data and control.
- Color coding can be used to distinguish between operations (e.g., arithmetic, comparison, phi) and control flow (regular vs. conditional branches).

This graph will clearly illustrate the data dependencies and control flow present in the provided IR code.
