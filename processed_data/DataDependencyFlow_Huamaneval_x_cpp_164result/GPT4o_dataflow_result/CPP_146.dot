To create a data flow graph (DFG) for the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we need to outline the key variables, operations, and control flow structures while highlighting their dependencies. Below is a textual representation of the DFG, followed by a suggestion on how to visualize it using a graphing library like Graphviz.

### Textual Representation of the Data Flow Graph

#### Nodes:
1. **Function Node: `_Z13specialFilterSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`**
2. **Variable Nodes:**
   - `%0`: Input vector (class.std::vector)
   - `%2`: Basic string (class.std::__cxx11::basic_string)
   - `%3`: Pointer to an element in vector
   - `%4`: Pointer to an element in vector
   - `%5`: Bitcast of `%2` to `i8*`
   - `%6`: Pointer to element 0 of string
   - `%7`: Pointer to element 1 of string
   - `%8`: Pointer to element 2 of string
   - `%9`: Bitcast of element pointer to `i8*`
   - `%10`, `%11`: Loaded pointers (from `%3`, `%4`)
   - `%12`: Comparison result (i1)
   - **Basic Block Nodes:**
     - **Block 13**: Conditional return block
     - **Block 15**: Main computation block
     - **Block 23**: String manipulation block
     - **Block 28**: Inner computation block
     - **Block 37**: Cleanup and end block
     - **Block 44**: Final return block

#### Edges (Dependencies):
- **From `%0` to `%3`, `%4`**: Input vector is used to get pointers to its elements.
- **From `%2` to `%5`, `%6`, `%7`, `%8`**: The string is allocated and pointers to its internal elements are generated.
- **From `%3` to `%10`, `%4` to `%11`**: The pointers are loaded to obtain the actual values from the vector.
- **From `%10` and `%11` to `%12`**: Used for the comparison operation to determine control flow.
- **From `%12` to `Block 13` and `Block 15`**: Control flow diverges based on the comparison.
- **From `Block 15` to `%16`, `%17`, `%18`, `%19`**: Variables initialized based on the control flow.
- **From `%21` to `%22`**: Value is compared to determine further control flow.
- **From `Block 23` to `Block 28`, `Block 37`**: Direct flow into string manipulation and further computations.
- **From `%19` to `%36`**: Result from a conditional computation updated based on a previous value.
- **From `Block 37` to `Block 44`**: Cleanup and final return path.

### Visualization Suggestion

To visualize the DFG using the Graphviz DOT format, you can use the following representation:

```dot
digraph G {
    // Define nodes
    node [shape=box];
    
    // Function Node
    func [label="_Z13specialFilterSt6vectorIiSaIiEE", shape=ellipse];
    
    // Variable Nodes
    input_vector [label="%0"];
    basic_string [label="%2"];
    ptr_elem1 [label="%3"];
    ptr_elem2 [label="%4"];
    bitcast_string [label="%5"];
    elem_ptr0 [label="%6"];
    elem_ptr1 [label="%7"];
    elem_ptr2 [label="%8"];
    comparison_result [label="%12"];
    
    // Basic Block Nodes
    block13 [label="Block 13"];
    block15 [label="Block 15"];
    block23 [label="Block 23"];
    block28 [label="Block 28"];
    block37 [label="Block 37"];
    block44 [label="Block 44"];
    
    // Define edges
    func -> input_vector;
    func -> basic_string;
    
    input_vector -> ptr_elem1;
    input_vector -> ptr_elem2;
    
    basic_string -> bitcast_string;
    basic_string -> elem_ptr0;
    basic_string -> elem_ptr1;
    basic_string -> elem_ptr2;

    ptr_elem1 -> comparison_result;
    ptr_elem2 -> comparison_result;

    comparison_result -> block13 [label="true"];
    comparison_result -> block15 [label="false"];
    
    block15 -> ptr_elem1;
    block15 -> ptr_elem2;
    
    block15 -> block23;
    block23 -> block28;
    block28 -> block37;
    block37 -> block44;
    
    block15 -> block44; // Cleanup path
}
```

### Usage:
- To visualize this graph, save the above DOT representation in a file (e.g., `dfg.dot`) and use Graphviz tools like `dot` to generate a graphical representation:
    ```
    dot -Tpng dfg.dot -o dfg.png
    ```

This approach provides a clear and structured visualization of the data dependencies and control flow in the IR code, allowing for better analysis and understanding of the program's behavior.
