To create a data flow graph (DFG) based on the given intermediate representation (IR) code, we need to identify the main components such as variables, operations, and control flow structures. Each node in the graph will represent a variable, operation, or function call, and the edges will represent the data dependencies between them.

### Data Flow Graph Description

#### Nodes:
1. **Function Entry**: `do_algebra`
2. **Basic Block 1**: `bb_1` (Initial comparisons and loads)
3. **Basic Block 2**: `bb_2` (Branch based on comparison results)
4. **Basic Block 3**: `bb_3` (Memory allocation and manipulation)
5. **Basic Block 4**: `bb_4` (More comparisons)
6. **Basic Block 5**: `bb_5` (Memory copying and conditional checks)
7. **Basic Block 6**: `bb_6` (Final comparisons and return)
8. **Function Calls**: 
   - `@llvm.memmove`
   - `@_ZdlPv` (Deallocation)
   - `@_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc` (Exception handling)
   - `@pow` (Power function)
   - `@_ZNKSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE7compareEPKc` (String comparison)

#### Edges (Dependencies):
- **Entry to Basic Block 1**: The function starts execution and moves to `bb_1`.
- **Basic Block 1 to Basic Block 2**: The results of comparisons in `bb_1` influence which block to execute next.
- **Basic Block 2 to Basic Block 3**: Depending on the comparisons, memory allocation and initialization might occur in `bb_3`.
- **Basic Block 3 to Basic Block 4**: Data loaded and stored within `bb_3` is used in `bb_4` for further computation.
- **Basic Block 4 to Basic Block 5**: Results from comparisons may lead to memory copies and checks in `bb_5`.
- **Basic Block 5 to Basic Block 6**: The operations in `bb_5` influence the final comparisons and potential return in `bb_6`.
- **Function Calls**:
  - From `bb_3` to `@llvm.memmove`: For memory operations.
  - From `bb_5` to `@_ZdlPv`: Conditional deallocations.
  - From `bb_4` and `bb_5` to `@_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc`: Exception handling based on conditions.
  - From `bb_6` to `@pow`: Power function call used within computations.
  - Comparisons in both `bb_4` and `bb_5` invoke `@_ZNKSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE7compareEPKc`.

### Visualization Suggestion
The DFG can be visualized using a directed graph layout. Hereâ€™s a suggested structure for the nodes and edges:

```
digraph G {
    rankdir=LR;
    
    // Nodes
    FunctionEntry [label="do_algebra", shape=circle];
    bb_1 [label="Basic Block 1", shape=box];
    bb_2 [label="Basic Block 2", shape=box];
    bb_3 [label="Basic Block 3", shape=box];
    bb_4 [label="Basic Block 4", shape=box];
    bb_5 [label="Basic Block 5", shape=box];
    bb_6 [label="Basic Block 6", shape=box];
    
    // Function Calls
    llvm_memmove [label="@llvm.memmove", shape=ellipse];
    ZdlPv [label="@_ZdlPv", shape=ellipse];
    throw_length_error [label="@_ZSt20__throw_length_errorPKc", shape=ellipse];
    pow_func [label="@pow", shape=ellipse];
    compare_func [label="@_ZNKSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE7compareEPKc", shape=ellipse];

    // Edges
    FunctionEntry -> bb_1;
    bb_1 -> bb_2;
    bb_2 -> bb_3;
    bb_3 -> bb_4;
    bb_4 -> bb_5;
    bb_5 -> bb_6;
    
    bb_3 -> llvm_memmove;
    bb_5 -> ZdlPv;
    bb_4 -> throw_length_error;
    bb_6 -> pow_func;
    bb_4 -> compare_func;
    bb_5 -> compare_func;
}
```

### Notes:
- The nodes are represented in different shapes indicating their types (circles for functions, boxes for basic blocks, ellipses for function calls).
- The edges indicate the flow of data from one node to another, demonstrating dependencies.
- This DFG can be generated and visualized using tools like Graphviz, which can convert the DOT format into graphical representations.
