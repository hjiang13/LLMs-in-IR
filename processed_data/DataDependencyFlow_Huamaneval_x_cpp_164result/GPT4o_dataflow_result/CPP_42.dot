To represent the data flow graph of the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we will construct a graph using nodes to represent variables, operations, and control flow constructs, while edges will represent dependencies between these nodes.

### Nodes
1. **Function Entry**
   - `@_Z9incr_listSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` (Function Entry)

2. **Load Operations**
   - `%4` (Load from vector %1)
   - `%6` (Load from vector %1)
   - `%70` (Load from vector %0, index 0)
   - `%71` (Load from vector %0, index 1)
   - `%72` (Load from vector %0, index 2)
   - `%74` (Load from vector %1, index 2)
   - `%78` (Load from vector %6, indexed by %77)
   - `%79` (Load from index %78)

3. **Arithmetic Operations**
   - `%9` (Subtract)
   - `%12` (Arithmetic Shift Right)
   - `%16` (Bitwise AND)
   - `%18` (Right Shift)
   - `%19` (Add)
   - `%25` (Phi for loop control)
   - `%26` (Phi for loop control)
   - `%33` (Add)
   - `%34` (Add)
   - `%44` (Add)
   - `%45` (Add)
   - `%52` (Phi for loop control)
   - `%61` (Add)
   - `%62` (Add)
   - `%80` (Add)

4. **Comparison Operations**
   - `%10` (Compare for equality)
   - `%13` (Result from call to `@llvm.umax.i64`)
   - `%14` (Compare less than)
   - `%21` (Compare for equality)
   - `%53` (Compare for equality)
   - `%66` (Compare for equality)
   - `%68` (Phi for loop control)

5. **Branching & Control Flow**
   - `br %10` (Branch based on %10)
   - `br %14` (Branch based on %14)
   - `br %21` (Branch based on %21)
   - `br %50` (Branch based on %50)
   - `br %53` (Branch based on %53)
   - `br %66` (Branch based on %66)
   - `br %82` (Branch based on %82)

6. **Function Calls**
   - `@llvm.umax.i64` (Function Call)
   - `@llvm.memset.p0i8.i64` (Function Call)

### Edges
- **Data Dependencies**
  - The result of loading from vector `%1` (`%4` and `%6`) is used in subsequent operations (`%7`, `%8`, `%9`, etc.).
  - The results of arithmetic operations (`%9`, `%12`, `%13`, etc.) feed into comparisons and further arithmetic operations.
  - The results of comparisons dictate control flow (branches) leading to different basic blocks.
  - The results of the function call to `@llvm.umax.i64` are used in further comparisons and operations.
  - The results of load operations are stored back into the vectors as seen with storing to `%70`, `%71`, etc.

### Suggested Visualization
In a diagrammatic representation:
- **Nodes** can be represented as circles or rectangles, labeled with the names of the variables/operations.
- **Edges** can be directed arrows indicating the flow of data from one operation to another.
- Control flow branches can be represented with bifurcating paths leading to different nodes based on conditions.
- You might consider using a tool like Graphviz to visualize this in DOT format, where you can represent nodes and edges explicitly.

### DOT Format
Hereâ€™s a simplified representation in dot format:

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    // Function Entry
    Entry [label="@_Z9incr_listSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];
    
    // Load Nodes
    Load1 [label="%4"];
    Load2 [label="%6"];
    Load3 [label="%70"];
    Load4 [label="%71"];
    Load5 [label="%72"];
    Load6 [label="%74"];
    Load7 [label="%78"];
    Load8 [label="%79"];
    
    // Arithmetic Nodes
    Op1 [label="%9"];
    Op2 [label="%12"];
    Op3 [label="%16"];
    Op4 [label="%18"];
    Op5 [label="%19"];
    Op6 [label="%25"];
    Op7 [label="%26"];
    Op8 [label="%33"];
    Op9 [label="%34"];
    Op10 [label="%44"];
    Op11 [label="%45"];
    Op12 [label="%52"];
    Op13 [label="%61"];
    Op14 [label="%62"];
    Op15 [label="%80"];
    
    // Comparison Nodes
    Comp1 [label="%10"];
    Comp2 [label="%13"];
    Comp3 [label="%14"];
    Comp4 [label="%21"];
    Comp5 [label="%53"];
    Comp6 [label="%66"];
    Comp7 [label="%68"];
    
    // Function Calls
    FuncCall1 [label="@llvm.umax.i64"];
    FuncCall2 [label="@llvm.memset.p0i8.i64"];
    
    // Edges
    Entry -> Load1;
    Entry -> Load2;
    Load1 -> Op1;
    Load2 -> Op1;
    Op1 -> Comp1;
    Op1 -> Op2;
    Op2 -> FuncCall1;
    FuncCall1 -> Comp2;
    Comp2 -> Op3;
    Op3 -> Comp3;
    
    // Add additional edges to represent the full flow
}
```

This DOT representation provides a structure to visualize the data flow in the IR code, highlighting the various operations and their interdependencies. You can run this in a tool like Graphviz to generate a visual representation of the data flow graph.
