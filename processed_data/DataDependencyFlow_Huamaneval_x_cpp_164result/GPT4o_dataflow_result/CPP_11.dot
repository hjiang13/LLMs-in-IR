Below is a detailed description of the data flow graph based on the provided intermediate representation (IR) code. The graph will represent the flow of data through the code, highlighting the dependencies between variables, the flow through operations, and relevant function calls.

### Data Flow Graph Description

#### Nodes
1. **Input Parameters**
   - `param_0`: Represents the first input parameter of type `basic_string`.
   - `param_1`: Represents the second input parameter of type `basic_string`.
   - `param_2`: Represents the third input parameter of type `basic_string`.

2. **Local Variables**
   - `var_4`: Represents the allocated structure for `basic_string`.
   - `var_5`: Represents the pointer to the union within the string.
   - `var_6`: Represents the pointer to the character data of the string.
   - `var_8`: Represents the length of the string (initialized to 0).
   - `var_9`: Represents the pointer to the size of the string.
   - `var_10`, `var_11`, `var_12`: Represents various pointers to the character data of input strings.
   - `var_13`: Represents the pointer to the union for the output string.
   - `var_14`: Represents the value loaded from `var_10`.
   - `var_15`: Represents the comparison result of `var_14` and 0.
   - `var_17`: Represents the value from the PHI node.
   - `var_18`: Represents the loaded value from `var_11`.
   - `var_19`: Represents the comparison result between `var_18` and `var_17`.
   - `var_21`: Represents the pointer to the character data of `param_0`.
   - `var_22`, `var_23`: Represents character data fetched from `param_1` and `param_2`.
   - `var_24`: Represents the comparison result between `var_22` and `var_23`.
   - `var_28`: Represents the incremented value of the length.
   - `var_29`: Represents the pointer to the character data for storing results.
   - `var_30`: Represents a pointer to the character data of `param_0`.
   - `var_31`: Represents the comparison result involving memory deallocation.
   - `var_38`: Represents the loaded pointer after the invoke operation.
   - `var_49`: Represents the character data pointer for outputting results.
   - `var_50`: Represents character value to be stored.
   - `var_51`: Represents the pointer where the character will be stored.
   - `var_54`: Represents the incremented value of the loop index.
   - `var_55`: Represents the loaded value for the loop condition.

3. **Control Flow Nodes**
   - `entry`: The entry point for the function.
   - `basic_block_16`: The block where control flows after checking `var_15`.
   - `basic_block_20`: The block handling the character comparison logic.
   - `basic_block_35`: A block indicating a decision based on the results of the previous computations.
   - `basic_block_36`: The block where mutation of the string occurs.
   - `basic_block_39`: A block handling exceptions and cleanup.
   - `basic_block_44`: A block indicating an alternative control flow path.
   - `basic_block_57`: The exit block of the function.
   - `basic_block_58`: A block handling the cleanup of resources.

#### Edges
- **Input Parameters to Local Variables**
  - `param_0` → `var_4`
  - `param_1` → `var_10`
  - `param_2` → `var_12`

- **Control Flow Edges**
  - `entry` → `basic_block_16`
  - `basic_block_16` → `basic_block_20` (if `var_15` is false)
  - `basic_block_20` → `basic_block_35` (if `var_19` is true)
  - `basic_block_20` → `basic_block_44` (if `var_19` is false)
  - `basic_block_35` → `basic_block_36`
  - `basic_block_36` → `basic_block_37`
  - `basic_block_39` → `basic_block_58`
  - `basic_block_44` → `basic_block_45`
  - `basic_block_45` → `basic_block_46`
  - `basic_block_57` → `basic_block_58`

- **Data Dependencies**
  - `var_4` → `var_5` (storing pointer of basic string)
  - `var_5` → `var_6` (pointing to character data)
  - `var_8` → `var_29` (storing length)
  - `var_10` ↔ `var_14` (length checking)
  - `var_18` → `var_19` (comparison for control flow)
  - `var_22` ↔ `var_23` (comparison for character data)
  - `var_28` → `var_50` (incrementing length)
  - `var_49` → `var_51` (storing the result)

### Visualization Suggestion
To visualize this data flow graph:

1. **Use a Graphing Tool**: Employ tools like Graphviz to create a `.dot` file.
2. **Node Representation**: Each of the nodes (variables and operations) can be represented as circles or boxes.
3. **Edge Representation**: Draw directed arrows from inputs to operations and between operations to represent data flow and dependencies.
4. **Color Coding**: Differentiate between types of nodes (e.g., input parameters, local variables, control flow nodes) using colors or styles (e.g., dashed lines for control flow).
5. **Basic Block Grouping**: Group nodes that belong to the same basic block visually or with a background color.

Here's a sample structure for the `.dot` format:

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    // Define nodes
    entry -> basic_block_16;
    basic_block_16 -> basic_block_20; // Control flow
    basic_block_20 -> basic_block_35; // If true
    basic_block_20 -> basic_block_44; // If false
    basic_block_35 -> basic_block_36;
    basic_block_36 -> basic_block_37;
    basic_block_39 -> basic_block_58;
    basic_block_44 -> basic_block_45;
    basic_block_45 -> basic_block_46;
    basic_block_57 -> basic_block_58;

    // Define variables
    param_0 -> var_4;
    param_1 -> var_10;
    param_2 -> var_12;
    var_4 -> var_5;
    var_5 -> var_6;
    var_8 -> var_29;
    var_10 -> var_14;
    var_18 -> var_19;
    var_22 -> var_23;
    var_28 -> var_50;
    var_49 -> var_51;
}
```

This structure can be expanded to represent all nodes and edges as described above, providing clarity in visualizing the data flow in the IR code.
