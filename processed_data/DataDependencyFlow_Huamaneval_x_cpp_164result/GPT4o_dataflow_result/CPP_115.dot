To analyze the provided intermediate representation (IR) code and construct a data flow graph, we will define the nodes and edges based on the operations and data dependencies. Each node will represent either a variable, an operation, or a basic block, and edges will represent the flow of data between these nodes.

### Data Flow Graph Description

2. **Basic Block 2**: 
   - Load vector pointer `%0`
3. **Basic Block 11**:
   - Operation: `sdiv exact i64 %9, 24`
   - Call: `@llvm.umax.i64`
4. **Basic Block 14**:
   - Operations: `phi` nodes for `%15`, `%16`
   - Load operations for vector elements (`%17`, `%19`)
5. **Basic Block 25**:
   - Operations: `ashr exact i64 %23, 2`

   - `phi` nodes for `%40`, `%41`, `%42`, `%43`
   - Load operations for vectors
8. **Basic Block 82**:

   - `icmp eq`
9. **Basic Block 89**:
   - Operations: `phi` nodes for `%90`, `%91`, `%92`, `%93`
   - Load operations for vectors
10. **Basic Block 105**:

    - `phi` nodes for `%112`, `%113`
12. **Basic Block 114**:
    - Return value `%115`
13. **Basic Block 116**:
    - Operations: `icmp sgt`
14. **Basic Block 119**:
    - `phi` nodes for `%120`, `%121`
15. **Basic Block 127**:
    - Operations: Arithmetic operations
16. **Basic Block 132**:
    - `phi` nodes for `%133`, `%134`

#### Edges
- **From Function Entry** to **Basic Block 2** (initial entry).
- **From Basic Block 2** to **Basic Block 11** (load operation).
- **From Basic Block 11** to **Basic Block 14** (data flow from division and call).
- **From Basic Block 14** to **Basic Block 25** (conditional branch).
- **From Basic Block 25** to **Basic Block 30** (data flow and branch).
- **From Basic Block 30** to **Basic Block 39** (conditional branch).
- **From Basic Block 39** to **Basic Block 82** (data flow).
- **From Basic Block 82** to **Basic Block 89** (conditional branch).
- **From Basic Block 89** to **Basic Block 105** (data flow).
- **From Basic Block 105** to **Basic Block 111** (data flow).
- **From Basic Block 111** to **Basic Block 114** (return).
- **From Basic Block 105** to **Basic Block 116** (conditional branch).
- **From Basic Block 116** to **Basic Block 127** (data flow).
- **From Basic Block 127** to **Basic Block 132** (data flow for loops).

### DOT Representation

Here's how to represent this data flow graph using DOT format:

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    // Nodes
    Entry [label="Function Entry @_Z8max_fillSt6vectorIS_IiSaIiEESaIS1_EEi"];
    BB2 [label="Basic Block 2"];
    BB11 [label="Basic Block 11"];
    BB14 [label="Basic Block 14"];
    BB25 [label="Basic Block 25"];
    BB30 [label="Basic Block 30"];
    BB39 [label="Basic Block 39"];
    BB82 [label="Basic Block 82"];
    BB89 [label="Basic Block 89"];
    BB105 [label="Basic Block 105"];
    BB111 [label="Basic Block 111"];
    BB114 [label="Basic Block 114"];
    BB116 [label="Basic Block 116"];
    BB119 [label="Basic Block 119"];
    BB127 [label="Basic Block 127"];
    BB132 [label="Basic Block 132"];

    // Edges
    Entry -> BB2;
    BB2 -> BB11;
    BB11 -> BB14;
    BB14 -> BB25;
    BB25 -> BB30;
    BB30 -> BB39;
    BB39 -> BB82;
    BB82 -> BB89;
    BB89 -> BB105;
    BB105 -> BB111;
    BB111 -> BB114;
    BB105 -> BB116;
    BB116 -> BB127;
    BB127 -> BB132;
}
```

### Visualization Suggestions
To visualize this diagrammatically:
1. Use a graph visualization tool that supports DOT format, such as Graphviz.
2. Generate the graph into an image format (like PNG or SVG) for easy viewing.
3. Use colors to differentiate between basic blocks, function calls, and operations for clarity.
4. You can also label edges to indicate the nature of data flow (e.g., "load", "store", "call").

This representation gives a clear overview of the data dependencies and flow in the provided IR code, which can aid in further analysis or optimization tasks.
