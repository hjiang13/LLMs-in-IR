### Edges
- Between variables and operations based on dependencies (e.g., a variable is the result of an operation and another operation might depend on that variable).
- Between basic blocks to indicate control flow (e.g., `%2` → `%12` when the condition is true).

### Example Edges
- `%4` (load from `%3`) → `%7` (ptrtoint)
- `%6` (load from `%5`) → `%8` (ptrtoint)
- `%9` (sub) → `%10` (ashr)
- `%11` (icmp) → `%12` (branch)
- `%12` → `%19` (if true)
- `%12` → `%17` (if false)
- `%19` → `%26` (if condition from phi nodes)

### Dot File Representation
The dot file format for visualization could look like this:

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    rankdir=LR;

    // Function and Entry
    node [shape=box];
    entry [label="_Z15rescale_to_unitSt6vectorIfSaIfEE", shape=ellipse];

    // Basic Blocks
    %2 [label="%2"];
    %12 [label="%12"];
    %17 [label="%17"];
    %19 [label="%19"];
    %26 [label="%26"];
    %40 [label="%40"];
    %44 [label="%44"];
    %47 [label="%47"];
    %58 [label="%58"];
    %60 [label="%60"];
    %79 [label="%79"];
    %82 [label="%82"];
    %89 [label="%89"];
    %91 [label="%91"];
    %93 [label="%93"];
    %128 [label="%128"];
    %135 [label="%135"];

    // Variables and Operations
    %3 [label="%3"];
    %4 [label="%4"];
    %5 [label="%5"];
    %6 [label="%6"];
    %7 [label="%7"];
    %8 [label="%8"];
    %9 [label="%9"];
    %10 [label="%10"];
    %11 [label="%11"];
    // ... (continue for all nodes) ...

    // Define edges based on dependencies
    entry -> %2;
    %2 -> %12;
    %12 -> %19;
    %12 -> %17;
    %19 -> %26;
    %26 -> %40;
    %40 -> %128;

    // Add other edges based on dependencies...
}
```

### Visualization Suggestions
You can visualize this graph using tools such as:
- Graphviz (command line tool)
- Online dot file viewers like `WebGraphviz` or `Viz.js`
- Integrate with visualization libraries in programming languages like Python (e.g., `networkx`, `pygraphviz`, or `matplotlib`)

This structure provides a foundational representation of the data flow through the IR code, highlighting the key nodes and their relationships.
