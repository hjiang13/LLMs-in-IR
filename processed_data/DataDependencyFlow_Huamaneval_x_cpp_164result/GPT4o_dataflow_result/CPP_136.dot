To create a data flow graph for the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will first identify the key components in the code, including variables, operations, and control flow structures. Then, we will outline the nodes and edges that represent the flow of data and their dependencies.

### Nodes
1. **Function Call: `@_Z25largest_smallest_integersSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`**
   - Entry point of the function.

2. **Load Operations:**
   - `%4`: Load from `%3` (data pointer from vector).
   - `%6`: Load from `%5` (data pointer from vector).

3. **Integer Operations:**
   - `%7`: Pointer to integer conversion of `%4`.
   - `%8`: Pointer to integer conversion of `%6`.
   - `%9`: Subtraction of `%7` and `%8`.
   - `%10`: Compare if `%9` is equal to zero.

4. **Branch Operations:**
   - **Branch 1:** If `%10` is true, go to label `%14`.
   - **Branch 2:** If `%10` is false, go to label `%11`.

5. **Basic Block `%11`:**
   - `%12`: Arithmetic right shift of `%9`.
   - `%13`: Call to `@llvm.umax.i64`.

6. **Basic Block `%14`:**
   - `%15`: Phi node for data flow.
   - `%16`: Another Phi node for data flow.
   - `%17`: Memory allocation via `@llvm.memset.p0i8.i64`.
   - `%18`: Memory allocation call `@_Znwm`.
   - `%19`: Cast of allocated memory to `i32*`.
   - `%20`: Store pointer to allocated memory.
   - `%21`, `%22`, `%23`: More pointer manipulations and stores.
   - Return operation.

7. **Basic Block `%28`:**
   - `%29`: Phi node.
   - `%30`, `%31`: More Phi nodes.
   - `%32`: Pointer arithmetic.
   - `%33`: Load from `%32`.
   - `%34`: Comparison if `%33` is less than zero.

8. **Branching Logic:**
   - **Block `%35`:** True branch from `%34`.
   - **Block `%40`:** False branch from `%34`.
   - **Block `%42`:** Additional comparisons and selections.
   
9. **Final Block `%47`:**
   - Multiple Phi nodes for final values to be returned.

### Edges
- **Data Flow Edges:**
  - From `%4` to `%7` (load to integer conversion).
  - From `%6` to `%8` (load to integer conversion).
  - From `%9` to `%10` (subtraction to comparison).
  - From `%10` to `%11` and `%14` (branching).
  - From `%12` to `%13` (arithmetic operation to function call).
  - From `@llvm.umax.i64` to `%13` (result of function call).
  - From `%15`, `%16` to `%17`, `%20`, `%21`, `%22`, `%23` (various stores).
  - From `%29`, `%30`, `%31` to `%32` (Phi nodes to pointer arithmetic).
  - From `%33` to `%34` (load to comparison).
  - From `%34` to `%35`, `%40` (branching based on comparison).
  - From `%35`, `%40`, `%42` back to `%47` (final values).

### Visualization in DOT Format
Below is a simplified representation of the data flow graph in DOT format. Each node is named and edges represent the data dependencies.

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    rankdir=LR;
    node [shape=box];

    func [label="Function: @_Z25largest_smallest_integersSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];
    load1 [label="%4: Load from vector"];
    load2 [label="%6: Load from vector"];
    ptr2int1 [label="%7: ptrtoint of %4"];
    ptr2int2 [label="%8: ptrtoint of %6"];
    sub [label="%9: Subtraction"];
    cmp_eq [label="%10: Compare eq to zero"];
    branch1 [label="Branch to %14"];
    branch2 [label="Branch to %11"];
    block11 [label="Basic Block %11"];
    block14 [label="Basic Block %14"];
    block28 [label="Basic Block %28"];
    block35 [label="Basic Block %35"];
    block40 [label="Basic Block %40"];
    block47 [label="Final Block %47"];

    // Edges
    func -> load1;
    func -> load2;
    load1 -> ptr2int1;
    load2 -> ptr2int2;
    ptr2int1 -> sub;
    ptr2int2 -> sub;
    sub -> cmp_eq;
    cmp_eq -> branch1;
    cmp_eq -> branch2;

    branch2 -> block11;
    branch1 -> block14;

    block11 -> block28; // Continue flow to block 28
    block14 -> block28; // Continue flow to block 28

    block28 -> block35;
    block28 -> block40;

    block35 -> block47;
    block40 -> block47;

    // Additional edges can be added for more detailed data flow
}
```

### Diagrammatic Visualization
To visualize this data flow graph, you can use graph visualization tools like Graphviz. You can take the provided DOT format and feed it into an online Graphviz editor or a local Graphviz installation to generate a graphical representation of the data flow.

### Summary
This data flow graph captures the essential operations and dependencies present in the IR code. The nodes represent various operations and variables, while the edges indicate how data flows and is manipulated throughout the function. You can extend the graph with more nodes and edges based on deeper analysis or additional details from the IR code.
