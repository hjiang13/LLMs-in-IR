To create a data flow graph (DFG) based on the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we will identify the key nodes (representing variables, operations, and control flow constructs) and the edges (representing data dependencies between these nodes). Below is a detailed description of the nodes and edges, followed by a sample DOT representation.

### Nodes
1. **Function Node**:
   - **@_Z11max_elementSt6vectorIfSaIfEE**
   
2. **Basic Blocks**:
   - **%1**: Entry block
   - **%10**: Block for the first branch (after `icmp eq`)
   - **%16**: Block for the second branch (when `ashr` is calculated)
   - **%18**: Block for the loop condition
   - **%23**: Block for the loop body
   - **%34**: Exit block
   - **%36**: Block for the second loop condition

3. **Variables**:
   - **%0**: Input parameter (vector)
   - **%2, %4**: Pointer calculations (GEPs)
   - **%3, %5**: Loaded pointers from vector data
   - **%6, %7**: Integer representations of pointers
   - **%8**: Difference between pointers
   - **%11 to %57**: Various variables for loop calculations and conditions (e.g., %12, %13, %19, %30, %35)
   - **%58**: Resulting maximum value found

### Edges
- **Control Flow Edges**:
   - From **%1** to **%10**, **%16** (based on the condition from the first comparison)
   - From **%10** to **%18** (loop condition)
   - From **%10** to **%16** (if not equal)
   - From **%18** to **%23** (loop body)
   - From **%23** to **%34** (exit condition)
   - From **%23** to **%18** (back to loop condition)
   - From **%16** to **%36** (if branch)
   - From **%36** to **%18** (back to loop condition)

- **Data Dependency Edges**:
   - From **%0** to **%2**, **%4** (input vector)
   - From **%2** to **%3** (loading pointer)
   - From **%4** to **%5** (loading pointer)
   - From **%3**, **%5** to **%6**, **%7** (pointer to integer conversion)
   - From **%6**, **%7** to **%8** (subtraction)
   - From **%8** to **%9** (comparison)
   - From **%11** to **%12** (after right shift operation)
   - From **%12** to **%14**, **%15** (further calculations)
   - From **%19** to **%35** (result accumulation)
   - From **%35** to return value

### DOT Representation
Here is how the data flow graph can be represented in the DOT format:

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    rankdir=LR;

    // Function Node
    Function [label="@_Z11max_elementSt6vectorIfSaIfEE", shape=box];

    // Basic Block Nodes
    Entry [label="%1" shape=ellipse];
    Block10 [label="%10" shape=ellipse];
    Block16 [label="%16" shape=ellipse];
    Block18 [label="%18" shape=ellipse];
    Block23 [label="%23" shape=ellipse];
    Block34 [label="%34" shape=ellipse];
    Block36 [label="%36" shape=ellipse];

    // Variable Nodes
    Input [label="%0" shape=oval];
    PointerGEP2 [label="%2" shape=oval];
    PointerGEP4 [label="%4" shape=oval];
    LoadedPointer3 [label="%3" shape=oval];
    LoadedPointer5 [label="%5" shape=oval];
    IntPtr6 [label="%6" shape=oval];
    IntPtr7 [label="%7" shape=oval];
    PointerDiff8 [label="%8" shape=oval];
    ResultMax35 [label="%35" shape=oval];

    // Control Flow Edges
    Function -> Entry;
    Entry -> Block10;
    Entry -> Block16;
    Block10 -> Block18;
    Block10 -> Block16;
    Block18 -> Block23;
    Block23 -> Block34;
    Block23 -> Block18;
    Block16 -> Block36;
    Block36 -> Block18;

    // Data Dependency Edges
    Input -> PointerGEP2;
    Input -> PointerGEP4;
    PointerGEP2 -> LoadedPointer3;
    PointerGEP4 -> LoadedPointer5;
    LoadedPointer3 -> IntPtr6;
    LoadedPointer5 -> IntPtr7;
    IntPtr6 -> PointerDiff8;
    IntPtr7 -> PointerDiff8;

    // Result accumulation
    ResultMax35 -> Block34;
}
```

### Visualization
The above DOT code can be visualized using Graphviz or similar tools. The nodes will represent variables, operations, and various blocks of code, while the arrows will indicate the flow of data and control through the function. You can use tools like [Graphviz Online](http://www.webgraphviz.com/) to visualize this graph, which will provide a clear depiction of the data flow in the IR code. 

This graphical representation will help in understanding how data moves through the program and how variables are interdependent during computation.
