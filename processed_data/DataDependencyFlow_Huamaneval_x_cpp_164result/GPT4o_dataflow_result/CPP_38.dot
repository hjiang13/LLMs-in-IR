To generate a data flow graph from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will identify key nodes representing variables, operations, and control flow constructs, and then we will establish directed edges between these nodes to indicate data dependencies and control flow.

### Node Description

#### Functions
1. **_Z13encode_cyclic**
2. **_Z13decode_cyclic**

#### Variables
- `%0`: Input variable of type `basic_string`
- `%1`: Input variable of type `basic_string`
- `%4`: Local variable of type `basic_string`
- `%5`: Local variable of type `basic_string`
- `%6`: Local variable of type `basic_string`
- `%7`: Local variable of type `basic_string`
- `%8`: Local variable of type `basic_string`
- `%3`: Temporary integer variable (allocated with `alloca`)
- `%9`: Pointer to an element in `basic_string`
- `%10`: Loaded value from `%9`
- `%11`: Truncated value from `%10`
- `%15`: Pointer to an element in `basic_string`
- `%67`: Result of a phi node (depends on control flow)

#### Control Flow Nodes
- `br`: Branching nodes for control flow
- `switch`: Switch statement nodes
- `invoke`: Invocations of functions
- `landingpad`: Exception handling nodes

### Edges
1. **Input to Function**:
   - `%0` and `%1` flow into `_Z13encode_cyclic`.
   - `%0` and `%1` flow into `_Z13decode_cyclic`.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `%1` → `%9` (through `getelementptr`)
   - `%9` → `%10` (load operation)
   - `%10` → `%11` (truncation)

3. **Data Store and Load**:
   - `%11` → `%15` (store operation)
   - `%4` → `%12` (lifetime start)
   - `%4` and `%5` flow into `store` operations for `basic_string`.

4. **Control Flow**:
   - `br` from comparison (e.g., `icmp`) leads to different blocks (e.g., `%55`, `%241`).
   - Control flow switches based on the comparison result (e.g., `%54`).

5. **Function Calls**:
   - Data flows into function calls (like `@llvm.memcpy`) based on variable values stored in previous operations.

6. **Phi Nodes**:
   - `%67` receives values from different predecessors based on control flow.

### Visualization

The data flow graph can be represented diagrammatically using the DOT language to create a visual representation. Below is a simplified representation of how the nodes and edges could be structured in a DOT format:

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    rankdir=TB;

    // Function nodes
    node [shape=box];
    EncodeFunction [label="_Z13encode_cyclic"];
    DecodeFunction [label="_Z13decode_cyclic"];
    
    // Variable nodes
    InputVar0 [label="%0"];
    InputVar1 [label="%1"];
    LocalVar4 [label="%4"];
    LocalVar5 [label="%5"];
    LocalVar6 [label="%6"];
    LocalVar7 [label="%7"];
    LocalVar8 [label="%8"];
    TempVar3 [label="%3"];
    Pointer9 [label="%9"];
    Loaded10 [label="%10"];
    Truncated11 [label="%11"];
    Pointer15 [label="%15"];
    Phi67 [label="%67"];

    // Control flow nodes
    Branch55 [label="Branch to %55"];
    Branch241 [label="Branch to %241"];
    
    // Edges
    InputVar0 -> EncodeFunction;
    InputVar1 -> EncodeFunction;
    InputVar0 -> DecodeFunction;
    InputVar1 -> DecodeFunction;
    
    EncodeFunction -> Pointer9;  // Example of a flow
    Pointer9 -> Loaded10; 
    Loaded10 -> Truncated11; 
    Truncated11 -> Pointer15;

    // Control flow edges
    Loaded10 -> Branch55;
    Loaded10 -> Branch241;

    // Phi node connections
    Branch55 -> Phi67;
    Branch241 -> Phi67;

    // Additional edges can be added based on detailed operations.
}
```

### Summary

The data flow graph outlined above represents a high-level overview of dependencies and control flow in the provided IR code. To visualize this diagrammatically, you can use graph visualization tools like Graphviz, which will render the structure based on the DOT description provided. Each variable and function will be represented as a box, with directed edges indicating how data flows between them.
