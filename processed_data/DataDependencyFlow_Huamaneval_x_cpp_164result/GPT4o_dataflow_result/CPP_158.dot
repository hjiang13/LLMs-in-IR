To create a data flow graph from the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we will represent the nodes as variables and operations, and the edges as dependencies and data flow paths. Below is a detailed description of the nodes and edges, followed by a representation in DOT format.

### Nodes
1. **Function Entry**: `_Z8find_maxSt6vector...` - Entry point of the function.
2. **Allocations**:
   - `%3` - Allocated space for `i64`.
   - `%4` - Allocated space for `basic_string`.
   - `%5` - Allocated space for another `basic_string`.
3. **Pointers**:
   - `%6` - Pointer to the `union.anon`.
   - `%7` - Bitcast pointer to `union.anon**`.
   - `%8` - Bitcast pointer to `i8*`.
4. **Data Access**:
   - `%9`, `%10`, `%11`, `%12` - GEPs accessing various fields of `basic_string` and `vector`.
5. **Comparison Operations**:
   - `%30` - Result of the equality comparison between two `basic_string` pointers.
6. **Branching**:
   - `%31`, `%34` - Labels for control flow.
7. **Phis**:
   - `%35`, `%36`, `%37` - Values for different branches.
8. **Function Calls**:
   - `@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8` - Starting lifetime for memory management.
   - `@llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64` - Memory copy operation.
   - `@__gxx_personality_v0` - Exception handling.
   - `@llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8` - Ending lifetime for memory management.
9. **Return**: `%248` - Return point of the function.

### Edges
- **Data Flow**:
  - From `%0` (input `basic_string`) to `%6` (pointer to `union.anon`).
  - `%3` influences `%4` and `%5` through allocations.
  - `%6` and `%7` lead to the values stored in the allocated strings.
  - The values in `%35`, `%36`, and `%37` flow from the comparison operations and branching.
  - Function calls like `@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8` and `@llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8` manage the lifetime of variables and are linked to their respective allocations.
  
### Visualization Suggestion
In a diagrammatic representation:
- Use circles or ellipses for nodes (variables, operations).
- Use directed arrows for edges, indicating the flow of data and dependencies.
- Group related nodes (like allocations and function calls) to show their interactions clearly.
- Use different colors or styles to differentiate between types of nodes (e.g., variables, operations, control flow).

### DOT Representation
Here is the DOT format representation of the data flow graph:

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    // Function Entry
    Entry [label="_Z8find_maxSt6vector..." shape=circle];

    // Allocations
    Alloc1 [label="%3 (i64)" shape=circle];
    Alloc2 [label="%4 (basic_string)" shape=circle];
    Alloc3 [label="%5 (basic_string)" shape=circle];

    // Data Access
    DataAccess1 [label="%6 (union.anon*)" shape=circle];
    DataAccess2 [label="%7 (union.anon**)" shape=circle];
    DataAccess3 [label="%8 (i8*)" shape=circle];
    
    // Comparison Operation
    Compare [label="%30 (eq)" shape=circle];

    // Branching
    Branch1 [label="%31" shape=circle];
    Branch2 [label="%34" shape=circle];

    // Phis
    Phi1 [label="%35" shape=circle];
    Phi2 [label="%36" shape=circle];
    Phi3 [label="%37" shape=circle];

    // Function Calls
    Call1 [label="@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8" shape=circle];
    Call2 [label="@llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64" shape=circle];
    Call3 [label="@llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8" shape=circle];

    // Return
    Return [label="%248 (return)" shape=circle];

    // Edges
    Entry -> DataAccess1;
    DataAccess1 -> Alloc1;
    DataAccess2 -> Alloc2;
    DataAccess3 -> Alloc3;
    Alloc1 -> Call1;
    Alloc2 -> Call2;
    Call1 -> Phi1;
    Call2 -> Phi2;
    Compare -> Branch1;
    Compare -> Branch2;
    Branch1 -> Phi2;
    Branch2 -> Return;
}
```

### Summary
The above representation outlines the nodes and their interconnections based on the provided IR code. This visualization can be rendered using DOT graph visualization tools (like Graphviz) to provide a clear graphical representation of the data flow through the function.
