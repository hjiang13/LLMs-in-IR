To represent the data flow in the given Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can create a directed graph using the DOT language format. In this graph, nodes will represent variables, operations, function calls, and control flow structures, while edges will represent data dependencies between these nodes.

### Nodes
1. **Function Entry**: `@_Z11intersperseSt6vectorIiSaIiEEi`
2. **Parameters**:
   - `%0`: Output vector
   - `%1`: Input vector
   - `%2`: Integer value
3. **Memory Operations**:
   - `@llvm.memset`
   - `@llvm.memmove`
   - `@_Znwm` (allocate memory)
   - `@_ZdlPv` (deallocate memory)
4. **Load Operations**:
   - `%6`: Load from `%4`
   - `%8`: Load from `%7`
   - `%15`: Load from `%8`
   - `%18`: Load from `%6`
5. **Store Operations**:
   - `%14`: Store to allocated memory
   - `%40`: Store integer value
   - `%75`: Store to `%68`
   - `%80`: Store to `%29`
   - `%123`: Store to `%28`
6. **Control Flow**:
   - `br` (conditional branches)
   - `invoke` (function calls that can throw)
   - `phi` (merge values from different control flow paths)
7. **Operations**:
   - `%9`: Compare pointers
   - `%35`: Compare shifted value
   - `%41`: Increment counter
   - `%50`: Check for length error
   - `%54`: Check zero
   - `%61`: Check for zero after computation
   - `%108`: Final check before memory allocation

### Edges
- Connect nodes based on data dependencies:
  - From parameters `%0`, `%1`, `%2` to the operations that utilize them.
  - From load operations to store operations indicating the data flow.
  - From conditional branches to the respective blocks they control.
  - From operations (like `icmp` or `add`) to subsequent operations that depend on their results.
  - From function calls to nodes representing their return values or effects on the data.

### DOT Representation
The following is a simplified version of how the graph might look in the DOT language:

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    // Function entry point
    entry [label="@_Z11intersperseSt6vectorIiSaIiEEi", shape=circle];
    
    // Parameters
    param0 [label="%0 (Output vector)", shape=box];
    param1 [label="%1 (Input vector)", shape=box];
    param2 [label="%2 (Integer value)", shape=box];

    // Load operations
    load6 [label="%6 (Load from %4)", shape=box];
    load8 [label="%8 (Load from %7)", shape=box];
    load15 [label="%15 (Load from %8)", shape=box];

    // Store operations
    store14 [label="%14 (Store to allocated memory)", shape=box];
    store40 [label="%40 (Store integer value)", shape=box];

    // Control flow
    condBranch1 [label="br %9", shape=diamond];
    condBranch2 [label="br %35", shape=diamond];

    // Memory operations
    memset [label="@llvm.memset", shape=box];
    memmove [label="@llvm.memmove", shape=box];
    newAlloc [label="@_Znwm", shape=box];
    delAlloc [label="@_ZdlPv", shape=box];

    // Entry connections
    entry -> param0;
    entry -> param1;
    entry -> param2;

    // Load connections
    param1 -> load6;
    param0 -> load8;

    // Store connections
    load15 -> store14;
    param2 -> store40;

    // Control flow connections
    load6 -> condBranch1;
    condBranch2 -> load6;
    
    // Memory operations
    store14 -> memset;
    store40 -> memmove;

    // More connections can be added based on detailed analysis
}
```

### Visualization
To visualize this graph:
1. Use a graph visualization tool that supports the DOT format, such as Graphviz.
2. Save the above DOT script to a file, e.g., `data_flow_graph.dot`.
3. Use the command line tool `dot` from Graphviz to generate a visual representation:
   ```
   dot -Tpng data_flow_graph.dot -o data_flow_graph.png
   ```
4. Open the generated `data_flow_graph.png` file to see the visual representation of the data flow in the IR code.

This representation captures the flow of data and highlights dependencies between operations, making it easier to analyze the IR code. Adjustments may be needed based on specific details or additional nodes and edges derived from a more thorough analysis of the code.
