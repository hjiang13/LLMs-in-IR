### Suggestions for Visualization

To visualize this data flow graph:

1. Use graph visualization tools such as Graphviz, which can process DOT files to generate graphical representations.
2. You can save the DOT representation in a `.dot` file and use Graphviz commands to generate an image (e.g., `dot -Tpng dataflow.dot -o dataflow.png`).
3. The resulting image will clearly illustrate the flow of data between nodes, making it easier to analyze the relationships and dependencies in the IR code.

This DFG will provide a clear view of how data flows through the various operations and conditions in your IR code, facilitating analysis and optimization efforts.
