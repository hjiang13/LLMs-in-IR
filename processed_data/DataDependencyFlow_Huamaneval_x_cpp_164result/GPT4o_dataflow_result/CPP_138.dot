To represent the data flow graph for the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will outline the nodes and edges based on the operations and data dependencies present in the function `is_equal_to_sum_eveni`. 

### Nodes and Edges Description

#### Nodes
1. **Input Node**
   - `Input %0` : The input parameter to the function.

2. **Operations**
   - `Op1: %2 = and i32 %0, 1` : This node represents the bitwise AND operation between the input and the constant 1.
   - `Op2: %3 = icmp eq i32 %2, 0` : This node checks if the result of `Op1` is equal to 0.
   - `Op3: %4 = icmp sgt i32 %0, 7` : This node checks if the input is greater than 7.
   - `Op4: %5 = and i1 %4, %3` : This node represents the AND operation between the results of `Op2` and `Op3`.

3. **Output Node**
   - `Output %5` : The return value of the function.

#### Edges
- From `Input %0` to `Op1: %2` : Represents the input flow to the first operation.
- From `Op1: %2` to `Op2: %3` : Represents the flow of the result of the AND operation to the comparison.
- From `Input %0` to `Op3: %4` : Represents the input flow to the second comparison.
- From `Op3: %4` to `Op4: %5` : Represents the flow of the result of the greater-than comparison to the final AND operation.
- From `Op2: %3` to `Op4: %5` : Represents the flow of the result of the equality comparison to the final AND operation.
- From `Op4: %5` to `Output %5` : Represents the return of the final result.

### DOT Format for Visualization
Below is the representation of the data flow graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    // Nodes
    Input [label="Input %0"];
    Op1 [label="Op1: %2 = and i32 %0, 1"];
    Op2 [label="Op2: %3 = icmp eq i32 %2, 0"];
    Op3 [label="Op3: %4 = icmp sgt i32 %0, 7"];
    Op4 [label="Op4: %5 = and i1 %4, %3"];
    Output [label="Output %5"];

    // Edges
    Input -> Op1;
    Op1 -> Op2;
    Input -> Op3;
    Op3 -> Op4;
    Op2 -> Op4;
    Op4 -> Output;
}
```

### Visualization Suggestions
To visualize this graph:
1. Use a graph visualization tool that can render DOT files, such as Graphviz. 
2. Save the above DOT representation in a file with a `.dot` extension.
3. Use the command line to generate an image, such as PNG or PDF:
   ```
   dot -Tpng data_flow_graph.dot -o data_flow_graph.png
   ```
4. Open the generated image file to view the data flow graph.

This representation clearly outlines the flow of data through the function and highlights the dependencies between the variables and operations involved.
