To create a data flow graph (DFG) based on the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we need to identify the key variables, operations, and control flow structures, and then represent them as nodes and edges in a DOT format.

### Key Elements in the IR Code

1. **Variables**:
   - `%0`: Input parameter of type `class.std::map`
   - `%2`: Allocated variable of type `i64`
   - `%3`: Allocated variable of type `class.std::__cxx11::basic_string`
   - `%4`, `%5`, `%6`: Intermediate pointers and loaded values.
   - `%7`: Loaded value from `%6`
   - `%8`: Result of comparison operation
   - `%10` to `%22`: Various pointers and values used in calculations
   - `%25` to `%80`: Values and control flow variables involved in branching and other operations.

2. **Operations**:
   - Load operations (e.g., `%7 = load i64, i64* %6`).
   - Comparison operations (e.g., `%8 = icmp eq i64 %7, 0`).
   - Branch operations (e.g., `br i1 %8, label %80, label %9`).
   - Function calls (e.g., `call void @llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8(...)`).

3. **Control Flow Structures**:
   - Entry point (function definition).
   - Branching structure leading to different basic blocks.

### Graph Structure

#### Nodes
- Each unique variable or operation will be represented as a node.
- The nodes will be labeled with their respective identifiers.

#### Edges
- Directed edges will represent the flow of data and dependencies between nodes.
- For example, if node A's output is used as input to node B, there will be an edge from A to B.

### DOT Format Representation

Hereâ€™s a basic outline of the DFG in DOT format:

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    input_map [label="%0: std::map"];
    alloc_i64 [label="%2: i64"];
    alloc_string [label="%3: std::__cxx11::basic_string"];
    load_value [label="%7: load(i64)"];
    compare_zero [label="%8: icmp eq"];
    branch_to_80 [label="branch to %80"];
    branch_to_9 [label="branch to %9"];
    load_rb_node [label="%12: load(_Rb_tree_node_base)"];
    function_call [label="call @llvm.lifetime.start"];
    // More nodes can be added as needed...

    // Edges
    input_map -> load_value;
    load_value -> compare_zero;
    compare_zero -> branch_to_80 [label="true"];
    compare_zero -> branch_to_9 [label="false"];
    load_value -> load_rb_node;
    load_rb_node -> function_call;
    // More edges can be added as needed...

    // Define the style
    rankdir=TB; // Top to Bottom orientation
}
```

### Visualization Suggestions

The DFG can be visualized using graph visualization tools such as Graphviz, which can render the DOT format into diagrams. To visualize the graph:

1. Save the DOT format code to a file, e.g., `data_flow_graph.dot`.
2. Use Graphviz command line tools or an online Graphviz visualizer to generate a graphical representation.
3. The nodes will be represented as boxes, and the edges will be arrows showing the flow of data.

### Summary

This DFG provides a high-level overview of how data flows through the IR code. Each node represents a key variable or operation, and each edge illustrates the dependency between them. By visualizing this graph, one can better understand the data dependencies and control flow within the code. You can expand this graph further by adding more nodes and edges corresponding to additional operations and variables found in the IR code.
