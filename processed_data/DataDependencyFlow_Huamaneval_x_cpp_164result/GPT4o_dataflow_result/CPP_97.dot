To construct a data flow graph (DFG) from the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we need to identify the key operations, variables, and their dependencies. The DFG will consist of nodes representing variables and operations, and edges indicating the flow of data between them.

### Nodes Definition
1. **Input Variables**:
   - `input0` (represents `%0`)
   - `input1` (represents `%1`)

2. **Function Calls**:
   - `llvm.abs.i32_0` (represents the result of `@llvm.abs.i32(i32 %0, i1 true)`)
   - `llvm.abs.i32_1` (represents the result of `@llvm.abs.i32(i32 %1, i1 true)`)

3. **Intermediate Operations**:
   - `urem_0` (represents `urem i32 %3, 10`)
   - `urem_1` (represents `urem i32 %5, 10`)

4. **Multiplication Operation**:
   - `mul` (represents `mul nuw nsw i32 %6, %4`)

5. **Return Value**:
   - `return_value` (represents `ret i32 %7`)

### Edges Definition
- `input0` → `llvm.abs.i32_0`
- `llvm.abs.i32_0` → `urem_0`
- `urem_0` → `mul`
- `input1` → `llvm.abs.i32_1`
- `llvm.abs.i32_1` → `urem_1`
- `urem_1` → `mul`
- `mul` → `return_value`

### Dot Format for Visualization
The following is a representation of the DFG in the DOT language format, which can be rendered using graph visualization tools such as Graphviz.

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    // Input nodes
    input0 [label="input0", shape=circle];
    input1 [label="input1", shape=circle];

    // Function call nodes
    llvm_abs_0 [label="llvm.abs.i32_0", shape=circle];
    llvm_abs_1 [label="llvm.abs.i32_1", shape=circle];

    // Intermediate operation nodes
    urem_0 [label="urem_0", shape=circle];
    urem_1 [label="urem_1", shape=circle];

    // Multiplication node
    mul [label="mul", shape=circle];

    // Return value node
    return_value [label="return_value", shape=circle];

    // Edges representing data flow
    input0 -> llvm_abs_0;
    llvm_abs_0 -> urem_0;
    urem_0 -> mul;

    input1 -> llvm_abs_1;
    llvm_abs_1 -> urem_1;
    urem_1 -> mul;

    mul -> return_value;
}
```

### Diagrammatic Visualization Suggestions
1. **Graph Layout**: Use a top-down layout where inputs are at the top, function calls and operations are in the middle, and the return value is at the bottom. This makes it easy to follow the flow of data.

2. **Node Shapes**: Use circles for operations and variables to maintain uniformity. Different colors can be used to differentiate between input variables, function calls, and operations.

3. **Edge Arrows**: Use directed arrows to represent the flow of data from one node to another. Ensure that the arrows are clear and do not overlap for better readability.

4. **Labels**: Clearly label each node with its corresponding variable or operation name to provide context for viewers.

This DFG provides a clear representation of how data flows through the operations in the given IR code, highlighting dependencies and the relationship between different variables and operations.
