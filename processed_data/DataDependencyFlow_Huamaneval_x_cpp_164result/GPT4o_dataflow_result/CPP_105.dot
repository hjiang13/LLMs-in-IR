To create a data flow graph (DFG) from the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we can outline the nodes and edges based on the dependencies and operations in the code. The nodes will represent variables, operations, and function calls, while the edges will represent the flow of data between these nodes.

### Nodes
1. **Function Entry**: `@_Z9by_lengthB5cxx11St6vectorIiSaIiEE`
2. **Variable Allocations**:
   - `%3`: `alloca i64`
   - `%4`: `alloca %"class.std::tuple"`
   - `%5`: `alloca %"class.std::tuple.17"`
   - `%6`: `alloca %"class.std::map"`
   - `%7`: `alloca [10 x %"struct.std::pair"]`
3. **Function Calls**:
   - `@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8`
   - `@llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64`
   - `@llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8`
4. **Data Structures**:
   - `%6`: `%"class.std::map"`
   - `%7`: `[10 x %"struct.std::pair"]`
5. **Control Flow**:
   - `%101`: Control flow block with multiple branches (PHI nodes)
   - `%106`: Control flow for the first branch
   - `%108`: Control for the second branch
   - `%114`: Control flow merging results from both branches

### Edges
- Data dependencies can be inferred from the usage of variables and results from function calls:
  - **From `%3`, `%4`, `%5`, `%6`, `%7` to function calls**: Alloca nodes lead to the initialization and manipulation of data structures.
  - **From `%7` to `@llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64`**: Indicates the copying of data from one place to another.
  - **From `%101` to `%106`, `%108`, and `%114`**: Control flow edges indicating branching logic based on conditions evaluated in the code.
  - **From `%106` and `%108` to `%114`**: Indicates merging of values depending on conditions.
  
### Graph Visualization
To visualize this DFG diagrammatically, you can use a graph visualization tool like Graphviz. Below is an example of how you might format the DFG in the DOT language for Graphviz:

```dot
digraph DFG {
    rankdir=LR; // Left to Right layout
    node [shape=box];

    // Nodes
    entry [label="@_Z9by_lengthB5cxx11St6vectorIiSaIiEE", shape=circle];
    alloc1 [label="%3: alloca i64"];
    alloc2 [label="%4: alloca class.std::tuple"];
    alloc3 [label="%5: alloca class.std::tuple.17"];
    alloc4 [label="%6: alloca class.std::map"];
    alloc5 [label="%7: alloca [10 x struct.std::pair]"];
    call1 [label="@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8"];
    call2 [label="@llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64"];
    call3 [label="@llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8"];
    control1 [label="%101: Control Flow Block"];
    control2 [label="%106: Control for First Branch"];
    control3 [label="%108: Control for Second Branch"];
    merge [label="%114: Merge Results"];

    // Edges
    entry -> alloc1;
    entry -> alloc2;
    entry -> alloc3;
    entry -> alloc4;
    entry -> alloc5;
    alloc1 -> call1;
    alloc2 -> call2;
    alloc3 -> call3;
    control1 -> control2;
    control1 -> control3;
    control2 -> merge;
    control3 -> merge;
}
```

### Explanation of the Visualization
- **Nodes**: Each node represents either a variable, a function call, or a control flow block. The shapes can be customized (e.g., circles for function entries, boxes for variables).
- **Edges**: Directed edges show the flow of data from one node to another. The direction indicates which node produces data that is consumed by another node.
- **Control Flow**: Merging nodes show where data from multiple branches comes together, which is essential for understanding how different conditions affect data flow.

This DFG representation allows for analysis of data dependencies and control flow in the provided IR code, which is critical for optimization and understanding program behavior.
