To create a data flow graph from the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we can outline the nodes and edges based on the dependencies between variables, operations, and control flow structures. Below is a textual description of the graph, including the nodes (operations and variables) and the edges (data dependencies).

### Data Flow Graph Description

#### Nodes
1. **Function Entry (`@_Z8exchangeB5cxx11St6vectorIiSaIiEES1_`)**
2. **Load Operations:**
    - Load from `%1` (vector 1)
    - Load from `%2` (vector 2)
3. **Arithmetic Operations:**
    - Subtraction: `%10 = sub i64 %8, %9`
    - Shift Right: `%11 = ashr exact i64 %10, 2`
    - Logical AND: `%17 = and i64 %14, -8`
    - Add: `%20 = add nuw nsw i64 %19, 1`
4. **Comparison Operations:**
    - Compare `%12 = icmp eq i64 %10, 0`
    - Compare `%15 = icmp ult i64 %14, 8`
    - Compare `%22 = icmp eq i64 %18, 0`
5. **Control Flow:**
    - Branching based on comparisons (e.g., `%br i1 %12, label %87, label %13`)
6. **PHI Nodes:**
    - `%26 = phi i64 [ 0, %23 ], [ %55, %25 ]`
    - `%27 = phi <4 x i32> [ zeroinitializer, %23 ], [ %53, %25 ]`
7. **Calls:**
    - Call to `@llvm.umax.i64`
    - Call to `@llvm.vector.reduce.add.v4i32`
8. **Store Operations:**
    - Store to `%"class.std::__cxx11::basic_string"` (final output)

#### Edges
- **Data Dependencies:**
    - Load from `%1` and `%2` influence the arithmetic operations (`%10`, `%11`, etc.).
    - The result of `%10` is input to `%11` and influences the branching decisions.
    - Results from comparison operations influence control flow and dictate which branches are taken.
    - Results from arithmetic contribute to the PHI nodes, which govern the values used in iterations.
    - Outputs from `@llvm.vector.reduce.add.v4i32` are used in subsequent operations.
    - The final store operation depends on the results of previous calculations and control flow decisions.

### Visualization Suggestions
To visualize this data flow graph, you could use a graph visualization tool like Graphviz that utilizes the DOT language to represent the nodes and edges. Here's how you could format the representation in DOT:

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    // Function Entry
    FunctionEntry [label="@_Z8exchangeB5cxx11St6vectorIiSaIiEES1_", shape=ellipse];

    // Load Operations
    LoadVector1 [label="Load from %1", shape=box];
    LoadVector2 [label="Load from %2", shape=box];

    // Arithmetic Operations
    Subtract [label="Subtraction (%10)", shape=box];
    ShiftRight [label="Shift Right (%11)", shape=box];
    LogicalAnd [label="Logical AND (%17)", shape=box];
    Add [label="Add (%20)", shape=box];

    // Comparison Operations
    CompareEq [label="Compare eq (%12)", shape=box];
    CompareUlt [label="Compare ult (%15)", shape=box];
    CompareEq2 [label="Compare eq (%22)", shape=box];

    // Control Flow
    Branch [label="Branch", shape=diamond];

    // PHI Nodes
    PhiNode1 [label="%26 = phi i64", shape=box];
    PhiNode2 [label="%27 = phi <4 x i32>", shape=box];

    // Calls
    CallMax [label="@llvm.umax.i64", shape=box];
    CallReduce [label="@llvm.vector.reduce.add.v4i32", shape=box];

    // Store Operation
    StoreOutput [label="Store to %0 (output)", shape=box];

    // Edges
    FunctionEntry -> LoadVector1;
    FunctionEntry -> LoadVector2;
    LoadVector1 -> Subtract;
    LoadVector2 -> Subtract;
    Subtract -> ShiftRight;
    ShiftRight -> CompareEq;
    CompareEq -> Branch;
    CompareUlt -> Branch;
    LogicalAnd -> PhiNode1;
    Add -> CallReduce;
    CallMax -> Branch;
    StoreOutput -> LoadVector1; // Example of how output is used
}
```

### Notes
- Each node represents either an operation, a variable, or a control flow decision.
- Edges represent the data dependencies between these nodes.
- The labels can be adjusted to provide more clarity based on your understanding of the operations and variables involved.
- The visualization can be generated using Graphviz by saving the DOT representation in a `.dot` file and running the Graphviz tool to produce an image or graphical representation of the graph.
