To create a data flow graph (DFG) based on the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we will identify the key nodes (variables, operations, and function calls) and the edges (data dependencies) between these nodes. The DFG will provide a high-level overview of how data flows through the function and how variables depend on one another.

### Nodes
1. **Input Node**
   - `%0`: Input parameter (basic_string)

2. **Load Operations**
   - `%3`: Load operation (length of the string)
   - `%7`: Load operation (pointer to the string data)
   - `%25`, `%28`: Load operations (load 4 bytes of string data)
   - `%42`, `%45`: Load operations (load 4 bytes of string data)
   - `%68`, `%71`: Load operations (load 4 bytes of string data)
   - `%97`: Load operation (load a single byte)

3. **Arithmetic Operations**
   - `%10`: Bitwise AND operation
   - `%11`: Addition operation
   - `%12`: Logical shift right operation
   - `%13`: Addition operation
   - `%17`: Bitwise AND operation
   - `%19`: Phi Node (determines value based on control flow)
   - `%37`, `%38`: Addition operations
   - `%56`, `%57`: Addition operations
   - `%86`: Addition operation (final accumulation)

4. **Comparison Operations**
   - `%4`: Comparison (checks if length is zero)
   - `%8`: Comparison (checks if index is less than 8)
   - `%15`, `%58`: Comparisons (checks boundaries)
   - `%50`, `%51`: Comparisons (checks if values are less than 26)
   - `%74`, `%79`: Comparisons (checks if values are less than 26)

5. **Select Operations**
   - `%33`, `%34`: Select operations (conditional selection based on comparisons)
   - `%50`, `%51`: Select operations (conditional selection based on comparisons)

6. **Function Calls**
   - `@llvm.vector.reduce.add.v4i32`: A function call to perform vector addition.

7. **Return Node**
   - `%93`: Return value of the function.

### Edges
- The edges represent dependencies between nodes. For example:
  - The output of the load operation `%3` feeds into the comparison nodes `%4`, `%8`, and others.
  - The results from arithmetic operations depend on the outputs from load operations (e.g., `%10` depends on `%3`).
  - The comparison results feed into the branching logic (e.g., `%4`, `%8`, `%15`, `%58` lead to different basic blocks).
  - The values computed in various nodes are passed to subsequent nodes, like the result of `%25` and `%28` going into `%37` and `%38`.
  - The final computed values are passed to the return node `%93`.

### DFG Representation in DOT Format
```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box]
    input [label="%0: Input (basic_string)"]
    load_len [label="%3: Load (length)"]
    load_data [label="%7: Load (data pointer)"]
    bitwise_and [label="%10: AND"]
    add1 [label="%11: Add"]
    shift_right [label="%12: LSR"]
    add2 [label="%13: Add"]
    phi1 [label="%19: Phi"]
    load_chunk1 [label="%25: Load (4 bytes)"]
    load_chunk2 [label="%28: Load (4 bytes)"]
    cmp1 [label="%4: Compare (length == 0)"]
    cmp2 [label="%8: Compare (index < 8)"]
    select1 [label="%33: Select"]
    add3 [label="%37: Add"]
    return_node [label="%93: Return"]

    // Edges (Data dependencies)
    input -> load_len
    load_len -> cmp1
    load_len -> load_data
    load_data -> bitwise_and
    load_data -> load_chunk1
    load_data -> load_chunk2
    bitwise_and -> add1
    add1 -> shift_right
    shift_right -> add2
    add2 -> phi1
    load_chunk1 -> add3
    load_chunk2 -> add3
    add3 -> return_node
    cmp1 -> return_node
    cmp2 -> return_node
}
```

### Visualization
To visualize this DFG:
1. Use graph visualization tools like Graphviz, which can interpret the DOT format.
2. The nodes will represent operations and variables, while directed edges will show data flow.
3. Color coding or grouping nodes based on function or operation type can help clarify the graph.

### Summary
This DFG captures the essential flow of data through the given IR code. The nodes encapsulate various operations and variables while the edges illustrate how data dependencies form a logical flow through the function's computation.
