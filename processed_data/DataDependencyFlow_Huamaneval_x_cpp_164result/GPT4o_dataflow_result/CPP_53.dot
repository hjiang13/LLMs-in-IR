To create a data flow graph (DFG) based on the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we will identify the relevant nodes (variables and operations) and edges (dependencies between them). The graph will focus on the function defined in the IR, which is a simple addition operation.

### Nodes:
1. **Function Entry**: `_Z3addii` (the entry point of the function)
2. **Input Variables**: 
   - `%0` (first input parameter)
   - `%1` (second input parameter)
3. **Operation Node**: 
   - `add` (the addition operation)
4. **Return Value**: 
   - `%3` (the result of the addition)

### Edges:
- An edge from **Function Entry** to both **Input Variables** `%0` and `%1` indicating that these inputs are read when entering the function.
- An edge from **Input Variable %0** to **Operation Node (add)** indicating that `%0` is used in the addition operation.
- An edge from **Input Variable %1** to **Operation Node (add)** indicating that `%1` is also used in the addition operation.
- An edge from **Operation Node (add)** to **Return Value %3** indicating that the result of the addition is stored in `%3`.
- An edge from **Return Value %3** to the **Function Exit** indicating that `%3` is the value returned by the function.

### Dot File Representation:
Here is how the DFG can be represented in the DOT format:

```dot
digraph data_flow_graph {
    // Define nodes
    entry [label="_Z3addii" shape=ellipse]
    input0 [label="%0" shape=box]
    input1 [label="%1" shape=box]
    operation [label="add" shape=diamond]
    return_value [label="%3" shape=box]
    exit [label="Function Exit" shape=ellipse]

    // Define edges
    entry -> input0
    entry -> input1
    input0 -> operation
    input1 -> operation
    operation -> return_value
    return_value -> exit
}
```

### Explanation of the Graph:
- **Nodes**: Each node is labeled to indicate its role in the data flow. The `shape` attribute is used to visually differentiate between function entry/exit, variables, and operations.
- **Edges**: Each directed edge (indicated by `->`) shows the flow of data and the dependencies of how inputs are used in the operation and how the result is returned.

### Visualization:
To visualize this graph, you can use tools like Graphviz, which can read DOT files and generate graphical representations. You can save the provided DOT format to a `.dot` file and then use Graphviz commands (such as `dot -Tpng filename.dot -o output.png`) to produce an image of the graph.

This graph effectively illustrates how data flows through the function and highlights the dependencies between inputs, operations, and outputs.
