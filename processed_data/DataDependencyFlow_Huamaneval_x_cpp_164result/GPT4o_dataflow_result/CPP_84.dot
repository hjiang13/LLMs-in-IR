To generate a data flow graph (DFG) for the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will represent the essential nodes and their dependencies based on the operations and variables used in the code. The nodes will represent variables, operations, or function calls, while edges will represent the flow of data between these nodes.

### Data Flow Graph Description

#### Nodes:
1. **Entry Node (start)**: The entry point of the function `_Z5solveB5cxx11i`.
2. **Allocations**:
   - `alloca1`: Allocation for the first `basic_string`.
   - `alloca2`: Allocation for the second `basic_string`.
   - `alloca3`: Allocation for the third `basic_string`.
   - `alloca4`: Allocation for the fourth `basic_string`.
3. **Function Calls**:
   - `llvm.lifetime.start`: For tracking the lifetime of allocated memory.
   - `__to_xstring`: A function call to `__to_xstring`.
   - `llvm.memcpy`: Memory copy operation.
   - `llvm.lifetime.end`: For ending the lifetime tracking.
4. **Branch Nodes**:
   - `branch1`: The first branch after the `invoke` instruction.
   - `branch2`: The second branch based on comparisons.
   - `branch3`: A branch for handling the end of the function.
5. **Load/Store Operations**:
   - `load1`: Load operation for reading from memory.
   - `store1`: Store operation for writing to memory.
6. **Control Flow Nodes**:
   - `if_condition`: Represents a conditional check.
   - `switch_case`: A switch-case structure for handling different values.
7. **Exit Node (end)**: The exit point of the function after all operations are complete.

#### Edges:
- **Data Flow**:
   - `Entry Node -> alloca1`
   - `Entry Node -> alloca2`
   - `alloca1 -> llvm.lifetime.start`
   - `alloca2 -> llvm.lifetime.start`
   - `llvm.lifetime.start -> __to_xstring`
   - `__to_xstring -> load1`
   - `load1 -> branch1`
   - `branch1 -> if_condition`
   - `if_condition -> store1`
   - `store1 -> branch2`
   - `branch2 -> switch_case`
   - `switch_case -> llvm.memcpy`
   - `llvm.memcpy -> llvm.lifetime.end`
   - `llvm.lifetime.end -> Exit Node`
   - Other edges include connections between `load` and `store` operations to signify dependencies.

### Visualization Suggestions
To visualize this DFG diagrammatically, you can use graph visualization tools such as Graphviz, which utilizes the DOT language. Hereâ€™s how the DFG can be represented in DOT format:

```dot
digraph DFG {
    rankdir=LR;
    start [label="Entry Node"];
    alloca1 [label="alloca1"];
    alloca2 [label="alloca2"];
    alloca3 [label="alloca3"];
    alloca4 [label="alloca4"];
    lifetime_start [label="llvm.lifetime.start"];
    to_xstring [label="__to_xstring"];
    load1 [label="load1"];
    store1 [label="store1"];
    branch1 [label="branch1"];
    branch2 [label="branch2"];
    if_condition [label="if_condition"];
    switch_case [label="switch_case"];
    memcpy [label="llvm.memcpy"];
    lifetime_end [label="llvm.lifetime.end"];
    end [label="Exit Node"];

    start -> alloca1;
    start -> alloca2;
    alloca1 -> lifetime_start;
    alloca2 -> lifetime_start;
    lifetime_start -> to_xstring;
    to_xstring -> load1;
    load1 -> branch1;
    branch1 -> if_condition;
    if_condition -> store1;
    store1 -> branch2;
    branch2 -> switch_case;
    switch_case -> memcpy;
    memcpy -> lifetime_end;
    lifetime_end -> end;
}
```

### How to Use the DOT Format
1. Save the above DOT format into a file, e.g., `dfg.dot`.
2. Use the Graphviz tool to generate a visual representation:
   ```bash
   dot -Tpng dfg.dot -o dfg.png
   ```
3. Open `dfg.png` to view the data flow graph.

This representation provides a structured overview of how data flows through the function, highlighting dependencies and control flow paths.
