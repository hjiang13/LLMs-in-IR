To create a data flow graph (DFG) based on the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will focus on the key components of the function `_Z6strlenNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE` and illustrate the flow of data through its operations. Below is a detailed description of the nodes and edges.

### Nodes:
1. **Function Entry**: `EntryNode`
2. **Input Parameter**: `Input: %0`
3. **GEP Operation**: `GEP: %2`
4. **Load Operation**: `Load: %3`
5. **Truncation Operation**: `Trunc: %4`
6. **Return Value**: `Return: %4`
7. **Function Exit**: `ExitNode`

### Edges:
- **Input to GEP**: Edge from `Input: %0` to `GEP: %2` indicating that the input parameter is used to compute the GEP.
- **GEP to Load**: Edge from `GEP: %2` to `Load: %3` showing that the result of the GEP operation is the address from which data is loaded.
- **Load to Truncation**: Edge from `Load: %3` to `Trunc: %4` indicating that the loaded value is truncated to a smaller type.
- **Truncation to Return**: Edge from `Trunc: %4` to `Return: %4` showing that the truncated value is returned by the function.
- **Return to Exit**: Edge from `Return: %4` to `ExitNode` indicating the end of the function execution.

### DFG in DOT Format:
```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    // Nodes
    EntryNode [label="Function Entry"];
    Input [label="Input: %0"];
    GEP [label="GEP: %2"];
    Load [label="Load: %3"];
    Trunc [label="Trunc: %4"];
    Return [label="Return: %4"];
    ExitNode [label="Function Exit"];

    // Edges
    EntryNode -> Input;
    Input -> GEP;
    GEP -> Load;
    Load -> Trunc;
    Trunc -> Return;
    Return -> ExitNode;
}
```

### Diagrammatic Visualization Suggestion:
1. **Graph Layout**: Use a top-down layout where the `EntryNode` is at the top, followed by the `Input`, `GEP`, `Load`, `Trunc`, `Return`, and `ExitNode` in that order.
2. **Node Shapes**: Use rectangles for operations and data types. The function entry and exit can be represented using rounded rectangles.
3. **Color Coding**: Different colors could be used to distinguish between operations (like GEP and Load) and data (like Input and Return).
4. **Edge Styles**: Solid arrows can represent the flow of data with directionality and dependency.

This representation allows for a clear understanding of how data flows through the function and how different operations depend on one another. Each node and edge in the graph reflects the operations and data dependencies present in the provided IR code.
