To create a data flow graph (DFG) from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we need to identify the key variables, operations, and control flow structures in the function `_Z12vowels_countNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`. 

### Nodes and Edges in the Data Flow Graph

**Nodes:**
1. **Function Entry**: Entry point of the function `_Z12vowels_count`.
2. **Input Parameter**: `%0` (input string).
3. **Allocate Basic String**: `%2`.
4. **Memory Copy**: Operation to copy the string constant `@.str` into the newly allocated string.
5. **Load Length**: `%10` (length of the input string).
6. **Comparison**: `%11` (check if length is 0).
7. **Load Base Pointer**: `%13` (pointer to the character data of the input string).
8. **Branch Decision**: `%11` (based on the comparison result).
9. **Load Character**: `%16`, `%18` (loading characters from the allocated string).
10. **Switch Statement**: `%23` (switch based on character value).
11. **Count Vowels**: `%40`, `%49` (incrementing vowel count).
12. **Return Value**: `%51` (total count of vowels).
13. **Function Exit**: Exit point of the function.

**Edges:**
- From **Function Entry** to **Input Parameter**: `%0` is passed as an argument.
- From **Input Parameter** to **Allocate Basic String**: `%0` is used to initialize `%2`.
- From **Allocate Basic String** to **Memory Copy**: `%2` is used for copying the string constant `@.str`.
- From **Memory Copy** to **Load Length**: The length is stored in the allocated string.
- From **Load Length** to **Comparison**: The length is compared to 0.
- From **Comparison** to **Branch Decision**: The result directs the control flow.
- From **Branch Decision** to **Load Base Pointer**: If the string is not empty, proceed to load the base pointer.
- From **Load Base Pointer** to **Load Character**: Characters are loaded from the base pointer.
- From **Load Character** to **Switch Statement**: The character value is passed to the switch statement.
- From **Switch Statement** to **Count Vowels**: Outcomes of the switch inform the incrementing of the vowel count.
- From **Count Vowels** to **Return Value**: The final count of vowels is prepared for return.
- From **Return Value** to **Function Exit**: The function exits returning the vowel count.

### Visualization Suggestion

For diagrammatic representation using the DOT language, we can format the nodes and edges as follows:

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    // Nodes
    entry [label="Function Entry"];
    input_param [label="Input Parameter (%0)"];
    alloc_string [label="Allocate Basic String (%2)"];
    memcpy [label="Memory Copy"];
    load_length [label="Load Length (%10)"];
    compare [label="Comparison (%11)"];
    load_base [label="Load Base Pointer (%13)"];
    branch_decision [label="Branch Decision"];
    load_char1 [label="Load Character (%16)"];
    load_char2 [label="Load Character (%18)"];
    switch_stmt [label="Switch Statement (%23)"];
    count_vowels [label="Count Vowels (%40, %49)"];
    return_val [label="Return Value (%51)"];
    exit [label="Function Exit"];

    // Edges
    entry -> input_param;
    input_param -> alloc_string;
    alloc_string -> memcpy;
    memcpy -> load_length;
    load_length -> compare;
    compare -> branch_decision;
    branch_decision -> load_base;
    load_base -> load_char1;
    load_base -> load_char2;
    load_char1 -> switch_stmt;
    load_char2 -> switch_stmt;
    switch_stmt -> count_vowels;
    count_vowels -> return_val;
    return_val -> exit;
}
```

### Explanation of Diagram

- **Nodes** represent important variables, operations, and control flow elements.
- **Edges** represent the flow of data and dependencies between operations.
- The graph begins at the function entry and ends at the function exit, illustrating the overall flow and dependencies of data throughout the function's execution. 

This structured representation helps in analyzing how data moves through the function and highlights key dependencies that are crucial for understanding the behavior of the code.
