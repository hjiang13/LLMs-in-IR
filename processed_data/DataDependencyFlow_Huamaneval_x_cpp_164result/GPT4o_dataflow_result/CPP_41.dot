To create a data flow graph from the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we will identify the key operations, variables, and their dependencies. Below is the outline of the data flow graph in a textual format, followed by a suggested DOT representation.

### Data Flow Graph Description

#### Nodes:
1. **Start**: Entry point of the function.
2. **Input**: Represents the input variable `%0`.
3. **Multiply Operation**: Represents the multiplication operation `mul nsw i32 %0, %0`.
4. **Return Value**: Represents the return value of the function, which is `%2`.
5. **End**: Exit point of the function.

#### Edges:
- **Start → Input**: The function begins with the input variable.
- **Input → Multiply Operation**: The input variable is used in the multiplication operation.
- **Multiply Operation → Return Value**: The result of the multiplication operation is assigned to `%2` (the return value).
- **Return Value → End**: The return value is passed out of the function, leading to the end of the function.

### DOT Representation

The following DOT representation describes the data flow graph based on the outlined nodes and edges:

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    // Node definitions
    Start [label="Start"];
    Input [label="Input (%0)"];
    Multiply [label="Multiply (%2 = mul nsw i32 %0, %0)"];
    Return [label="Return Value (%2)"];
    End [label="End"];

    // Edges (data dependencies)
    Start -> Input;
    Input -> Multiply;
    Multiply -> Return;
    Return -> End;
}
```

### Visualization Suggestions

To visualize the data flow graph:
1. **Graphviz**: Use Graphviz software to render the DOT representation into a visual graph. You can save the DOT code in a `.dot` file and use the `dot` command to generate an image (e.g., PNG or SVG).
   - Command: `dot -Tpng yourfile.dot -o output.png`
2. **Online Tools**: There are several online Graphviz viewers where you can input the DOT code and visualize the graph without installing anything locally. Sites like [WebGraphviz](http://webgraphviz.com/) can render the graph from the DOT input.

### Summary

The data flow graph provides a clear visual representation of how the data is processed within the function, highlighting variable dependencies and the flow of data through operations. This can be particularly useful for debugging, optimization, and understanding the overall structure of the code.
