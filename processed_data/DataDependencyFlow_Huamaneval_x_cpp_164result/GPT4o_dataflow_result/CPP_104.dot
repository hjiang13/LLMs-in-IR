To create a data flow graph (DFG) based on the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we will identify the key variables, operations, and function calls, and represent them as nodes in the graph. The edges will represent the data dependencies between these nodes.

### 1. Nodes in the Graph

**Key Nodes (Variables and Operations):**
- **Function Node:** `@_Z13unique_digitsSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`
- **Load Operations:** 
  - `%9` (load from `%3`)
  - `%10` (load from `%4`)
  - `%31` (load from `%30`)
  - `%32` (load from `%31`)
  - `%40` (load from `%39`)
  - `%75` (load from `%30` in a heap allocation)
- **ICMP Operations:**
  - `%11` (icmp eq)
  - `%13` (icmp eq)
  - `%17` (icmp sgt)
  - `%19` (icmp ugt)
- **Store Operations:**
  - `%51` (store to `%28`)
  - `%90` (store to `%7`)
  - `%91` (store to `%5`)
- **Function Calls:**
  - `@llvm.memset.p0i8.i64`
  - `@llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64`
  - `@__gxx_personality_v0`
  - `@llvm.ctlz.i64`
  - `@_ZSt16__introsort_loop...`
  - `@_ZSt22__final_insertion_sort...`

### 2. Edges in the Graph

**Edges Representing Data Dependencies:**
- **Control Flow:**
  - From `%11` to `%12` (based on the result of the previous comparison)
  - From `%11` to `%23` (branching based on comparison)
  
- **Data Dependencies:**
  - From `%9` to `%11` (loading into `%9` is used for comparison)
  - From `%10` to `%11` (loading into `%10` is used for comparison)
  - From `%31` to `%32` (load operation feeding into a subsequent operation)
  - From `%40` to `%41` (result of an operation affecting another operation)
  - From `%51` (store operation) to `%7` (indicating a write to a variable)
  
- **Function Call Dependencies:**
  - From `%3` to `@llvm.memset.p0i8.i64` (data initialized)
  - From `%4` to `@llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64` (data moved)
  - From `%30` to `@_ZSt16__introsort_loop...` (data passed to sorting function)

### 3. Graph Visualization

The graph can be visualized using tools like Graphviz, which uses the DOT language. Below is a simplified representation of how the DFG could be structured in DOT format.

```dot
digraph DFG {
    // Function Node
    Function [label="@_Z13unique_digitsSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];

    // Load Nodes
    Load9 [label="%9"];
    Load10 [label="%10"];
    Load31 [label="%31"];
    Load32 [label="%32"];
    Load40 [label="%40"];
    Load75 [label="%75"];

    // ICMP Nodes
    ICMP11 [label="%11"];
    ICMP13 [label="%13"];
    ICMP17 [label="%17"];
    ICMP19 [label="%19"];

    // Store Nodes
    Store51 [label="%51"];
    Store90 [label="%90"];
    Store91 [label="%91"];

    // Function Calls
    FuncCallMemset [label="@llvm.memset.p0i8.i64"];
    FuncCallMemmove [label="@llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64"];
    FuncCallSortingLoop [label="@_ZSt16__introsort_loop..."];
    FuncCallFinalInsertion [label="@_ZSt22__final_insertion_sort..."];

    // Edges
    Function -> Load9;
    Function -> Load10;
    Function -> Load31;
    Function -> Load32;
    Function -> Load40;
    Function -> Load75;
    
    Load9 -> ICMP11;
    Load10 -> ICMP11;
    Load31 -> Load32;
    Load40 -> Store51;

    Store51 -> Store90;
    Store90 -> FuncCallMemset;
    Store91 -> FuncCallMemmove;
    FuncCallSortingLoop -> Store90;
    FuncCallFinalInsertion -> Store91;
}
```

### Summary

This DFG captures the data flow and control dependencies in the provided IR code. Each node represents either a variable or an operation, while edges represent how data flows between them. The suggested visualization technique using Graphviz can be used to create a graphical representation, which will help in analyzing the data dependencies within the code.
