To represent the data flow of the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we can create a data flow graph in the DOT format. In this graph, nodes represent variables, operations, and control flow constructs, while edges represent the flow of data and dependencies between them.

### Nodes Description

1. **Function Entry**: `@_Z3eatiii`
2. **Inputs**:
   - `%0`: Pointer to `std::vector`
   - `%1`: Integer
   - `%2`: Integer
   - `%3`: Integer
3. **Comparisons**:
   - `%5`: Comparison result of `%3 < %2`
4. **Memory Allocation**:
   - `%7`: Pointer from `_Znwm` (memory allocation)
5. **Basic Block 8**:
   - `%9`: Result of `(%3 + %1)`
   - `%10`: Pointer to `i32*` from `%7`
   - `%12`: Pointer to next element in the vector
   - `%13`: Pointer to vector data
6. **Basic Block 15**:
   - `%16`: Result of `(%3 - %2)`
   - `%17`: Result of `(%2 + %1)`
   - `%18`: Pointer to `i32*` from `%7`
7. **Merge Block 23**:
   - `%24`: Phi node to select from `%16` or `0`
   - `%25`: Phi node to select between `%20` or `%12`
   - `%26`: Pointer to another memory location in `%7`
   - `%27`: Pointer to `i32*` from `%26`
   - `%28`: Pointer to another element in the vector
   - `%29`: Pointer to `i8**` from `%28`
8. **Function Exit**: `ret void`

### Edges Description

- **Function Entry** to **Inputs**: Represents the entry of the function and the parameters being passed.
- **Inputs** to **Comparison**: Indicates that the comparison is dependent on `%3`, `%2`.
- **Comparison** to **Basic Block 8**: Flow of control based on the comparison result.
- **Basic Block 8** to **Memory Allocation**: Memory allocation happens when the condition `%5` is true.
- **Memory Allocation** to **Basic Block 8**: Represents the allocated memory being used to store values.
- **Basic Block 8** to **Basic Block 23**: Control flow from the block to the merge block after storing values.
- **Basic Block 15** to **Basic Block 23**: Control flow from the alternate block to the merge block.
- **Basic Block 23** to **Function Exit**: Represents the exit point of the function following completion of operations.

### DOT Format Representation

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    // Nodes
    Entry [label="@_Z3eatiii", shape=circle];
    Input0 [label="%0: std::vector*", shape=ellipse];
    Input1 [label="%1: i32", shape=ellipse];
    Input2 [label="%2: i32", shape=ellipse];
    Input3 [label="%3: i32", shape=ellipse];
    Comparison [label="%5: %3 < %2", shape=diamond];
    Allocation [label="%7: _Znwm", shape=box];
    Block8 [label="Basic Block 8", shape=box];
    Block15 [label="Basic Block 15", shape=box];
    MergeBlock [label="Basic Block 23", shape=box];
    Exit [label="Function Exit", shape=circle];

    // Edges
    Entry -> Input0;
    Entry -> Input1;
    Entry -> Input2;
    Entry -> Input3;
    Input3 -> Comparison;
    Input2 -> Comparison;
    Comparison -> Block8 [label="true"];
    Comparison -> Block15 [label="false"];
    Block8 -> Allocation;
    Allocation -> Block8;
    Block8 -> MergeBlock;
    Block15 -> MergeBlock;
    MergeBlock -> Exit;
}
```

### Visualization Suggestions

1. **Node Shapes**:
   - Use circles for function entry and exit.
   - Use ellipses for inputs (variables).
   - Use diamonds for comparison operations.
   - Use boxes for basic blocks and operations.

2. **Edge Representation**:
   - Directed edges can show the flow of data and control.
   - Optionally, labels can indicate conditional paths (e.g., true/false conditions).

3. **Graph Layout**:
   - Use a hierarchical layout to show the flow from the entry point through comparisons and basic blocks to the exit point.

This DOT representation can be visualized using tools like Graphviz, which can render the graph based on the provided format. Simply save the DOT code to a file (e.g., `data_flow_graph.dot`) and use the command `dot -Tpng data_flow_graph.dot -o data_flow_graph.png` to generate a visual representation.
