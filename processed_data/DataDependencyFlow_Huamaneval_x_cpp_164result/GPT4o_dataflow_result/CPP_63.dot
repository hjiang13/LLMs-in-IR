To represent the data flow graph (DFG) from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we can extract the main variables and operations, along with their dependencies. Below is a detailed text description of the nodes (variables and operations) and edges (data dependencies), followed by a suggestion for how this could be visualized diagrammatically using the DOT format.

### Data Flow Graph Description

#### Nodes:
1. **Input**: `%0` (input parameter to the function)
2. **Allocations**: `%2` (allocated array of integers)
3. **Stores**:
   - `%4`: store `0` at index `0`
   - `%5`: store `0` at index `1`
   - `%6`: store `1` at index `2`
   - `%11`: store `1` at index `3`
4. **Arithmetic Operations**:
   - `%9`: `add nuw i32 %0, 1`
   - `%10`: `zext i32 %9 to i64`
   - `%14`: `and i64 %10, 1`
   - `%17`: `add nsw i64 %10, -4`
   - `%18`: `and i64 %17, -2`
   - `%20`, `%21`, `%22`, `%23`: `phi` nodes for carrying values across control flow
   - `%26`: `getelementptr` for loading value from the array
   - `%28`: `add nsw i32 %27, %21`
   - `%29`: `add nsw i32 %28, %23`
5. **Loads**:
   - `%27`: `load i32` from array using index
   - `%34`: return value from array at index `%32`
6. **Control Flow**:
   - `br i1 %7`: branch based on comparison
   - `br i1 %12`: branching logic based on comparison
   - `br i1 %15`: branching logic based on comparison
   - Other branches leading to `%19` and `%25`
7. **Return**: `ret i32 %34`

#### Edges (Data Dependencies):
- From `%0` to `%9` (input influences the addition operation)
- From `%9` to `%10` (output of addition affects zero extension)
- From `%10` to `%14` (AND operation depends on zero extended value)
- From `%0` to `%7` (comparison to determine branch)
- From `%10` to `%12` (comparison for branching logic)
- From `%9` to `%11` (store operation influenced by the increment of `%0`)
- From `%20`, `%21`, `%22`, `%23` to `%24` (phi nodes depend on previous values)
- From `%26` to `%27` (loading value depends on the address calculation)
- From `%27`, `%21`, `%23` to `%28` (addition operation)
- From `%28` to `%29` (final calculation before storing)
- From `%34` to `ret` (return value)

### DOT Format Representation
Here is a simplified representation of the data flow graph in DOT format:

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    // Nodes
    node [shape=box];
    Input [label="%0 (input)"];
    Alloc [label="%2 (alloca)"];
    Store_0 [label="%4 (store 0)"];
    Store_1 [label="%5 (store 0)"];
    Store_2 [label="%6 (store 1)"];
    Store_3 [label="%11 (store 1)"];
    Add_1 [label="%9 (add nuw)"];
    Zext [label="%10 (zext)"];
    And_1 [label="%14 (and)"];
    Add_2 [label="%17 (add nsw)"];
    And_2 [label="%18 (and)"];
    Phi_1 [label="%20 (phi)"];
    Load [label="%27 (load)"];
    Add_3 [label="%28 (add nsw)"];
    Add_4 [label="%29 (add nsw)"];
    Return [label="%34 (return)"];

    // Edges
    Input -> Add_1;
    Add_1 -> Zext;
    Zext -> And_1;
    Input -> Store_0;
    Input -> Store_1;
    Input -> Store_2;
    Add_1 -> Store_3;
    Zext -> Add_2;
    Zext -> Store_3;
    Phi_1 -> Load;
    Load -> Add_3;
    Add_3 -> Add_4;
    Add_4 -> Return;
}
```

### Visualization Suggestion
To visualize this graph:
1. Use graph visualization tools like Graphviz, which can read DOT files and render them as images (PNG, PDF, etc.).
2. The nodes can be represented as boxes (as shown in the `shape=box` in the DOT format), and the edges can be directed arrows indicating the flow of data.
3. Use distinct colors for nodes based on their type (input, allocation, load, store, arithmetic operations) for better readability.

This representation provides a clear overview of how data moves through the function, highlighting dependencies and control flow.
