To generate a data flow graph (DFG) from the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we will identify the key variables, operations, and flow control structures, and then outline the nodes and edges accordingly. 

### Node Definition
1. **Function Node**: Represents the function defined in the IR.
   - Node: `split_words`

2. **Variable Nodes**: Represents variables and data structures used in the function.
   - Nodes: 
     - `vector` (class `std::vector`)
     - `string` (class `std::__cxx11::basic_string`)
     - `i64` (used for length and indexing)
     - `i8` (used for character data)
     - `union.anon` (used in string manipulation)

3. **Operation Nodes**: Represents key operations on the above variables.
   - Nodes: 
     - `alloca` (memory allocation)
     - `getelementptr` (pointer arithmetic)
     - `load` (loading values from memory)
     - `store` (storing values to memory)
     - `call` (function calls)
     - `icmp` (integer comparisons)
     - `br` (branching)
     - `switch` (switch-case structure)

4. **Control Flow Nodes**: Represents different control flow paths.
   - Nodes: 
     - `conditional_branch`
     - `loop`
     - `switch_case`

### Edge Definition
- **Data Dependency Edges**: Show how data flows from one variable or operation to another. 
- **Control Flow Edges**: Indicate the direction of control flow through branches and loops.

### Data Flow Graph Representation
Hereâ€™s a textual representation of the DFG with nodes and edges:

#### Nodes:
- `Function: split_words`
- `Variable: vector`
- `Variable: string`
- `Variable: length (i64)`
- `Variable: char (i8)`
- `Variable: union.anon`
- `Operation: alloca`
- `Operation: getelementptr`
- `Operation: load`
- `Operation: store`
- `Operation: call`
- `Operation: icmp`
- `Operation: br`
- `Operation: switch`
- `Control Flow: conditional_branch`
- `Control Flow: loop`
- `Control Flow: switch_case`

#### Edges:
1. `split_words -> vector`  
2. `split_words -> string`  
3. `vector -> store`  
4. `string -> load`  
5. `length -> icmp`  
6. `char -> load`  
7. `alloca -> store`  
8. `getelementptr -> load`  
9. `load -> store`  
10. `store -> vector`  
11. `switch_case -> conditional_branch`  
12. `loop -> conditional_branch`
13. `conditional_branch -> br`  
14. `br -> switch`  
15. `switch -> case branches` (for various cases, e.g., 1, 2, 3)

### Visualization Suggestions
To visualize this data flow graph diagrammatically, you can use tools like Graphviz with the DOT language. Below is a basic example of how you might structure the DFG in DOT format:

```dot
digraph DFG {
  node [shape=rectangle];
  
  split_words -> vector;
  split_words -> string;
  vector -> store;
  string -> load;
  length -> icmp;
  char -> load;
  alloca -> store;
  getelementptr -> load;
  load -> store;
  store -> vector;
  switch_case -> conditional_branch;
  loop -> conditional_branch;
  conditional_branch -> br;
  br -> switch;
  
  // Switch cases
  switch -> case_1 [label="case 1"];
  switch -> case_2 [label="case 2"];
  switch -> case_3 [label="case 3"];
}
```

### Final Notes
The above representation can be enhanced with additional details regarding the specific operations or values involved as needed. Each node can be visualized as a box, and directed edges can represent the flow of data between these nodes. You can use Graphviz or similar tools to create a more visually appealing graph based on this structure.
