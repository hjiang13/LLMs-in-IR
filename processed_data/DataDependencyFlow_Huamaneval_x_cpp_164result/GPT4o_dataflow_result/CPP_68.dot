To create a data flow graph (DFG) based on the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we need to identify the key nodes (variables, operations, and function calls) and the edges that represent the data dependencies between these nodes. Below is a detailed text description of the DFG, followed by an outline of how it can be visualized in a dot format.

### DFG Nodes and Edges Description

#### Nodes:
1. **Function Entry Node**: 
   - `@_Z5pluckSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`

2. **Local Variables**:
   - `%3` - Allocated memory (i64)
   - `%4` - Bitcast of `%3` to `[2 x i32]*`
   - `%5`, `%6` - GEP (GetElementPtr) operations on input vector `%1`
   - `%7`, `%8` - GEP operations on output vector `%0`
   - `%9`, `%10`, `%11`, `%12`, `%13`, `%14`, `%15` - Various pointers and addresses used for memory operations
   - `%17`, `%18` - Loaded pointers from `%5`, `%6`
   - `%19` - Comparison result (icmp)
   - `%21`, `%22`, `%23`, `%24` - phi nodes for control flow
   - `%26` - Loaded value from pointer computed via GEP
   - `%30`, `%31`, `%32` - Loaded and converted pointers for address calculations
   - `%33`, `%34`, `%35` - Various arithmetic and comparison operations
   - `%37`, `%38`, `%39` - Operations involving memory allocation and checks
   - `%46`, `%47`, `%49`, `%50`, `%51`, `%52`, `%54`, `%56`, `%57`, `%58`, `%60`, `%62`, `%66`, `%67`, `%70`, `%71`, `%73`, `%76`, `%79` - Operations for memory management and data manipulation
   - `%80`, `%81`, `%83`, `%84`, `%86`, `%87`, `%89`, `%90`, `%91`, `%92`, `%93`, `%94`, `%95`, `%96`, `%97` - Intermediate results and final read/write operations.

3. **Function Calls**:
   - `@llvm.memset.p0i8.i64`
   - `@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8`
   - `@llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8`
   - `@_ZdlPv`
   - `@_Znwm`
   - `@llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64`
   - `@llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64`

4. **Control Flow Nodes**:
   - Conditional branches based on comparisons (`icmp` results)
   - phi nodes representing multiple control flow paths

5. **Function Exit Node**:
   - Return from `@_Z5pluckSt6vectorIiSaIiEE`

#### Edges:
- Data dependencies between local variables (e.g., `%3` influences `%4`, which is used in subsequent computations).
- Control flow edges between basic blocks (e.g., branches based on the condition of `%19` leading to either basic block `%20` or `%98`).
- Function call edges where data is passed to and from the called functions (e.g., outputs from `@llvm.memset.p0i8.i64` influence the flow to subsequent operations).
- Phi node inputs connect multiple potential data sources depending on control flow.

### Dot Format Representation

Below is a basic structure of how the DFG can be represented in DOT format. Each node will be labeled with its identifier, and edges will show dependencies.

```dot
digraph DFG {
    // Nodes
    entry [label="Function Entry: @_Z5pluckSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];
    alloc [label="%3: Alloc"];
    bitcast1 [label="%4: Bitcast to [2 x i32]*"];
    gep_input1 [label="%5: GEP input"];
    gep_input2 [label="%6: GEP input"];
    gep_output1 [label="%7: GEP output"];
    gep_output2 [label="%8: GEP output"];
    load_input1 [label="%17: Load from %5"];
    load_input2 [label="%18: Load from %6"];
    icmp_eq [label="%19: icmp eq"];
    
    // Control Flow
    block20 [label="Block 20"];
    block29 [label="Block 29"];
    block36 [label="Block 36"];
    block39 [label="Block 39"];
    block46 [label="Block 46"];
    block54 [label="Block 54"];
    block72 [label="Block 72"];
    block78 [label="Block 78"];
    exit [label="Function Exit: ret"];

    // Function Calls
    memset [label="call: @llvm.memset.p0i8.i64"];
    lifetime_start [label="call: @llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8"];
    lifetime_end [label="call: @llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8"];
    malloc [label="call: @_Znwm"];
    free [label="call: @_ZdlPv"];
    memmove [label="call: @llvm.memmove.p0i8.p0i8.i64"];
    
    // Edges
    entry -> alloc;
    alloc -> bitcast1;
    bitcast1 -> gep_input1;
    bitcast1 -> gep_input2;
    
    gep_input1 -> load_input1;
    gep_input2 -> load_input2;
    
    load_input1 -> icmp_eq;
    load_input2 -> icmp_eq;
    
    icmp_eq -> block20;
    block20 -> block29;
    block29 -> block36;
    block36 -> block39;
    
    // More edges to be defined for full flow...
    
    block39 -> memset;
    memset -> block46;
    block46 -> malloc;
    malloc -> block54;
    block54 -> lifetime_end; 
    lifetime_end -> exit;
    
    // Add remaining edges for full flow...
}
```

### Visualization:
You can visualize this graph using Graphviz by saving the DOT format code into a `.dot` file and using the `dot` command to generate an image (e.g., PNG, SVG) of the graph. The command would look like this:
```bash
dot -Tpng your_graph.dot -o output.png
```

This generated DFG would provide a clear visual representation of the data flow and dependencies within the given IR code.
