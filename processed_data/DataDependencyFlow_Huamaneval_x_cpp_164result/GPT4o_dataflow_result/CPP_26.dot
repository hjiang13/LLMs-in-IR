To create a data flow graph from the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we need to identify the nodes and edges based on the variables, operations, and flow control structures present in the code. Here’s how we can outline the data flow graph in a text-based format, suitable for visualization in the DOT format commonly used with Graphviz.

### Nodes
- **Function Node**: `_Z17remove_duplicatesSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` (the main function).
  
- **Basic Block Nodes**: Each basic block will be labeled with a unique identifier (like `BB1`, `BB2`, etc.), corresponding to the labels in the IR code. The following are some key basic block labels extracted from the IR:
  - `BB9`
  - `BB24`
  - `BB38`
  - `BB41`
  - `BB46`
  - `BB50`
  - `BB54`
  - `BB58`
  - `BB100`
  - `BB105`
  - `BB168`
  - `BB250`
  - `BB265`
  - `BB267`
  - `BB273`
  - `BB274`
  
- **Variable Nodes**: Each variable referenced in the IR should be represented as a node. Here are some significant variable names:
  - `%0` (output vector)
  - `%1` (input vector)
  - `%6`, `%7`, `%10`, `%11`, `%12`, `%13`, `%14`, `%15`, `%16`, etc. (pointers to various elements in vectors)
  - `%40`, `%44`, `%87`, etc. (intermediate calculation results)
  
- **Constant Nodes**: Any constants that appear in the code should also be represented, such as `0`, `1`, `15`, etc.

### Edges
The edges in the graph represent data dependencies between nodes. The edges will be directed, indicating the flow of data from one node to another. Here are some examples of edges based on the operations in the IR:

- From `%1` (input vector) to `%3` (pointer to an element in the input vector).
- From `%6` to `%8` (comparison operation).
- From `%10` to `%15` (pointer arithmetic).
- From `%12` to `%17` (pointer to integer conversion).
- From `%40` to `%44` (loading values from memory).
- From `%87` to `%100` (branching based on comparisons).

### DOT Representation (Graphviz Format)
Here’s how we could format the basic structure in DOT:

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    // Function Node
    function [label="_Z17remove_duplicatesSt6vectorIiSaIiEE", shape=box];

    // Basic Block Nodes
    BB9 [label="BB9", shape=box];
    BB24 [label="BB24", shape=box];
    BB38 [label="BB38", shape=box];
    BB41 [label="BB41", shape=box];
    BB46 [label="BB46", shape=box];
    BB50 [label="BB50", shape=box];
    BB54 [label="BB54", shape=box];
    BB58 [label="BB58", shape=box];
    BB100 [label="BB100", shape=box];
    BB105 [label="BB105", shape=box];
    BB168 [label="BB168", shape=box];
    BB250 [label="BB250", shape=box];
    BB265 [label="BB265", shape=box];
    BB267 [label="BB267", shape=box];
    BB273 [label="BB273", shape=box];
    BB274 [label="BB274", shape=box];

    // Variable Nodes
    var0 [label="%0", shape=circle];
    var1 [label="%1", shape=circle];
    var6 [label="%6", shape=circle];
    var7 [label="%7", shape=circle];
    var10 [label="%10", shape=circle];

    // Edges
    function -> BB9;
    BB9 -> var1; // Input vector
    var1 -> var6; // Pointer to input vector
    var6 -> BB24; // Flow to next block
    var10 -> var7; // Operations on pointers
    BB24 -> BB100; // Control flow edge
    BB100 -> var0; // Output vector
    // Add further edges based on dependencies and control flow...
}
```

### Visualization Suggestion
To visualize this data flow graph:
1. Use Graphviz, a tool that can interpret the DOT format.
2. Save the DOT representation in a `.dot` file.
3. Use a command such as `dot -Tpng yourfile.dot -o output.png` to generate a PNG image of the graph.
4. Ensure to add more edges based on specific operations and dependencies found in the IR code.

This outline provides a way to visualize the flow of data through the code, highlighting variable dependencies, control flow, and operations in a structured manner. To complete the graph, further nodes and edges should be added based on the detailed analysis of the IR code.
