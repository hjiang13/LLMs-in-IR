To generate a data flow graph (DFG) from the provided intermediate representation (IR) code, we will outline the nodes (representing variables, function calls, and operations) and edges (indicating the data dependencies between these nodes). The graph will primarily focus on the `even_odd_count` function, as it's the main function in the provided code.

### Nodes and Edges Description

1. **Nodes**:
   - **Function Node**:
     - `even_odd_count`
   - **Variables**:
     - `%0`: Represents the input vector.
     - `%1`: Represents the input integer (count).
     - `%3`: Represents a string (temporary variable).
     - `%5`: Result of `llvm.abs.i32` function.
     - `%7`: Loaded value from string at index 1.
     - `%8`: Pointer to the character data of the string.
     - `%10`: Conditional check result (comparison).
     - `%12`: Conditional check result (comparison).
     - `%14`: Intermediate calculations (offset).
     - `%16`: Pointer for indexing.
     - `%35`, `%36`: Accumulators for even and odd counts.
     - `%39`, `%40`: Intermediate results from vector reductions.
     - `%44`, `%46`: Result from vector additions.
     - `%51`, `%52`: Final counts of odd and even numbers.
     - `%54`, `%55`: Final counts stored in the vector.
     - `%57`: Pointer for memory allocation.
     - `%68`, `%70`: Loop counters and conditions.
     - `%90`: Landing pad for exception handling.

2. **Edges**:
   - **Data Dependencies**:
     - `%1` flows into the `%5` through the `llvm.abs.i32` call.
     - `%5` is used in the call to `vsnprintf`, resulting in modifications to `%3`.
     - The result of `%3` is used to check conditions leading to different branches (`%10`, `%12`).
     - The calculated values from `phi` nodes (e.g., `%16`, `%35`, `%36`) are dependent on previous loop iterations.
     - The results from vector operations (`%39` and `%40`) are summed to produce the final output values (`%51`, `%52`).
     - Memory management nodes (e.g., `%57`, `%83`) are linked to the function call for allocation and deallocation.
     - The landing pad node `%90` connects exception handling logic.

### Dot File Representation

Here is a simplified representation of how the DFG might be structured in DOT format:

```dot
digraph DFG {
    rankdir=LR;

    // Function Node
    even_odd_count [label="even_odd_count", shape="box"];

    // Variables
    input_vector [label="%0: Vector", shape="ellipse"];
    input_integer [label="%1: Integer", shape="ellipse"];
    temp_string [label="%3: String", shape="ellipse"];
    abs_result [label="%5: Abs Result", shape="ellipse"];
    string_value [label="%7: String Value", shape="ellipse"];
    char_pointer [label="%8: Char Pointer", shape="ellipse"];
    comparison_1 [label="%10: Comparison 1", shape="ellipse"];
    comparison_2 [label="%12: Comparison 2", shape="ellipse"];
    intermediate [label="%14: Intermediate", shape="ellipse"];
    index_pointer [label="%16: Index Pointer", shape="ellipse"];
    even_count [label="%35: Even Count", shape="ellipse"];
    odd_count [label="%36: Odd Count", shape="ellipse"];
    final_even [label="%51: Final Even", shape="ellipse"];
    final_odd [label="%52: Final Odd", shape="ellipse"];
    memory_alloc [label="%57: Memory Alloc", shape="ellipse"];
    loop_counter_1 [label="%68: Loop Counter 1", shape="ellipse"];
    loop_counter_2 [label="%70: Loop Counter 2", shape="ellipse"];
    landing_pad [label="%90: Landing Pad", shape="ellipse"];

    // Edges
    even_odd_count -> input_vector;
    even_odd_count -> input_integer;
    input_integer -> abs_result;
    abs_result -> temp_string;
    temp_string -> comparison_1;
    comparison_1 -> comparison_2;
    comparison_2 -> index_pointer;
    index_pointer -> even_count;
    index_pointer -> odd_count;
    even_count -> final_even;
    odd_count -> final_odd;
    final_even -> memory_alloc;
    memory_alloc -> landing_pad;
    loop_counter_1 -> landing_pad;
    loop_counter_2 -> landing_pad;
}
```

### Visualization Suggestions
- **Graph Layout**: Use a left-to-right layout to represent the flow of data logically from function input to output.
- **Node Shapes**: Use rectangular boxes for function nodes and circular or elliptical shapes for variable nodes to distinguish between operations and data.
- **Color Coding**: Consider color coding nodes based on their role (e.g., blue for input variables, green for calculations, red for control flow).
- **Graph Tools**: Use graph visualization tools like Graphviz to render the DOT file into an understandable visual diagram.

### Conclusion
The above description and representation provide a comprehensive overview of the data flow in the `even_odd_count` function, highlighting the relationships and dependencies between variables and operations. You can use the DOT file to visualize the data flow graph using appropriate tools.
