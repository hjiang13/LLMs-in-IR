To create a data flow graph (DFG) from the provided IR code, we can identify the key variables, operations, and control flow structures. Below is a detailed outline of the nodes and edges of the DFG, along with a suggestion for diagrammatic visualization.

### Nodes
Each node in the DFG represents either a variable, an operation, or a function. We will label each node according to its type:

1. **Variables**:
   - `%0`: Input vector (class.std::vector)
   - `%1`: Read-only input vector (class.std::vector)
   - `%3`: Local variable of type i64
   - `%4`: Local variable of type i64
   - `%5`: Local variable of type i64
   - `%6`: Local variable of type std::__cxx11::basic_string
   - `%7`: Local variable of type std::__cxx11::basic_string
   - `%8`: Local variable of type std::__cxx11::basic_string
   - `%9`: Local variable of type std::__cxx11::basic_string
   - `%10`: Local variable of type std::__cxx11::basic_string

2. **Operations**:
   - `alloca`: Allocating memory for local variables
   - `load`: Loading values from memory
   - `store`: Storing values to memory
   - `getelementptr`: Pointer arithmetic to access elements
   - `icmp`: Integer comparison
   - `br`: Branching based on conditions
   - `call`: Function calls (e.g., memory functions, std::string functions)
   - `invoke`: Handling exceptions during function calls

3. **Functions**:
   - `@llvm.memset.p0i8.i64`
   - `@llvm.lifetime.start.p0i8`
   - `@llvm.lifetime.end.p0i8`
   - `@__gxx_personality_v0`
   - `@llvm.vector.reduce.add.v4i32`
   - `@llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64`
   - Other specific functions related to strings and memory management.

### Edges
Edges represent data dependencies between nodes. An edge from node A to node B indicates that B depends on A. Below are some key edges based on operations and data flow:

- **Data Flow**:
  - Input vectors `%0` and `%1` are read and processed through various `load` and `getelementptr` operations.
  - Variables `%3`, `%4`, `%5`, and `%6` are allocated and modified.
  - The result of `load` operations on `%11`, `%12` is used by `icmp` comparisons.
  - Branching operations (`br`) determine the flow based on comparisons, leading to further computations or function calls.

### Suggested Diagrammatic Visualization
You could visualize the DFG using a directed graph where:
- **Nodes** are represented as circles or rectangles labeled with the variable names, operations, or functions.
- **Edges** are directed arrows pointing from the nodes that produce data to the nodes that consume data.
- Conditional branches can be represented as splits in the graph, leading to different paths based on the results of comparisons.

### Example Dot File Format
Below is a simplified version of how the DFG could be represented in DOT format:

```dot
digraph DFG {
    rankdir=LR; // Left to right orientation

    // Node definitions
    node [shape=box];
    InputVector0 [label="%0 Input Vector"];
    InputVector1 [label="%1 Read-Only Vector"];
    Var3 [label="%3 (i64)"];
    Var4 [label="%4 (i64)"];
    Var5 [label="%5 (i64)"];
    Var6 [label="%6 (std::string)"];
    Var7 [label="%7 (std::string)"];
    Var8 [label="%8 (std::string)"];
    Var9 [label="%9 (std::string)"];
    Var10 [label="%10 (std::string)"];
    
    // Operation nodes
    Load1 [label="load from %11"];
    Load2 [label="load from %12"];
    ICMP [label="icmp comparison"];
    Branch1 [label="branch based on ICMP"];
    CallFunc1 [label="call @llvm.memset"];
    CallFunc2 [label="call @llvm.lifetime.start"];

    // Edges
    InputVector0 -> Load1;
    InputVector1 -> Load2;
    Load1 -> ICMP;
    Load2 -> ICMP;
    ICMP -> Branch1;
    Branch1 -> CallFunc1;
    // Additional edges can be added similarly
}
```

### Conclusion
This DFG captures the essential data flow and control dependencies in the provided IR code. The visualization can help in understanding how different parts of the code interact and how data is manipulated throughout the function.
