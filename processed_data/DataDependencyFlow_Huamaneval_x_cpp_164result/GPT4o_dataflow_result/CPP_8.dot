To create a data flow graph (DFG) representing the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will outline the nodes (representing variables, operations, and control flow constructs) and edges (indicating data dependencies). Below is a detailed description of the nodes and edges, followed by a suggested visualization format in DOT language.

### Nodes:
1. **Function Declaration**
   - `@_Z11sum_productSt6vectorIiSaIiEE` (entry point)

2. **Basic Blocks**
   - `%2` (entry block)
   - `%11` (first conditional block)
   - `%15` (second conditional block)
   - `%22` (third conditional block)
   - `%24` (loop block)
   - `%55` (loop exit block)
   - `%66` (conditional block for final computations)
   - `%77` (final processing block)
   - `%91` (end block for one branch)
   - `%87` (end block for another branch)
   - `%105` (finalization block)

3. **Variables and Operations**
   - `%3`, `%4` (loading vector data)
   - `%7`, `%8`, `%9` (pointer manipulations and comparisons)
   - `%12`, `%13`, `%14` (arithmetic and comparisons)
   - `%16` to `%21` (further computations)
   - `%25` to `%30` (phi nodes for loop iterations)
   - `%31` to `%47` (loading and processing vector elements)
   - `%56` to `%64` (phi nodes for outputs)
   - `%73`, `%74`, `%75`, `%76` (final computations before return)
   - `%83`, `%85` (result computations)
   - `%92`, `%93` (final return values)

### Edges:
- **Control Flow Edges**:
  - From `%2` to `%11` (branching based on condition)
  - From `%11` to `%15` (continuation of execution)
  - From `%15` to `%22` (flowing into nested conditions)
  - From `%22` to `%24` (loop entry)
  - From `%24` back to `%24` (looping)
  - From `%24` to `%55` (loop exit)
  - From `%55` to `%66` (conditional processing)
  - From `%66` to `%77` (final processing)
  - From `%77` to `%91` (branching to return)
  - From `%11` to `%87` (conditional processing)
  - From `%87` to `%105` (finalization)

- **Data Flow Edges**:
  - From `%4` to `%7` (data loaded from vector)
  - From `%6` to `%8` (data loaded from vector)
  - From `%9` to `%12` (result of arithmetic)
  - From `%12` to `%13` (result of shift operation)
  - From `%13` to `%14` (comparison operation)
  - From `%16` to `%19` (arithmetic operations)
  - From `%19` to `%20` (conditional branching)
  - From `%25` to `%31` (phi node usage)
  - From `%31` to `%33`, `%34` (loading vector elements)
  - From `%37` to `%41` (arithmetic operations)
  - From `%56` to `%78` (final computation flow)
  - From `%91` to `%92`, `%93` (return value preparation)

### Suggested DOT Representation:
```dot
digraph DFG {
    rankdir=LR;
    node [shape=box];

    Entry [label="@_Z11sum_productSt6vectorIiSaIiEE"];
    entry_block [label="%2"];
    cond1 [label="%11"];
    cond2 [label="%15"];
    cond3 [label="%22"];
    loop_block [label="%24"];
    exit_block [label="%55"];
    final_cond [label="%66"];
    final_block [label="%77"];
    end_block1 [label="%91"];
    end_block2 [label="%87"];
    finalization_block [label="%105"];

    Entry -> entry_block;
    entry_block -> cond1;
    cond1 -> cond2;
    cond2 -> cond3;
    cond3 -> loop_block;
    loop_block -> loop_block; // Looping
    loop_block -> exit_block;
    exit_block -> final_cond;
    final_cond -> final_block;
    final_block -> end_block1;
    cond1 -> end_block2;
    end_block2 -> finalization_block;
    exit_block -> finalization_block;
}
```

### Visualization:
To visualize this graph, you can use graph visualization tools such as Graphviz. 

1. Save the DOT representation to a `.dot` file (e.g., `data_flow_graph.dot`).
2. Use Graphviz command-line tool:
   ```bash
   dot -Tpng data_flow_graph.dot -o data_flow_graph.png
   ```
3. Open the generated `data_flow_graph.png` to view the data flow graph. 

This diagram will represent the flow of data through the IR code, illustrating how variables and operations interconnect and how control flows through the different basic blocks.
