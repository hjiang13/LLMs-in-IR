Label: yes

Explanation: The variable `%19` in the function `_Z4fib4i` is data-dependent on the variable `%40`. The variable `%19` is assigned a value from the `phi` node at label `%17`, which is derived from earlier computations in the function, while `%40` is also generated as a `phi` node at label `%38`. The use of `%19` in computations involving loading and storing values indicates that it directly affects the result that is dependent on `%40`. The data flow is evident through operations like loads and stores, where values are read and written based on these variables.
