Label: no

Explanation: In the provided IR code, the function `truncate_number` takes a single floating-point argument `%0` and performs calculations to derive a return value, `%4`. The operations include converting `%0` to an integer (`fptosi`), converting back to float (`sitofp`), and then performing a subtraction to yield the final result. There are no references or usages of any variable named `[VAR_NAME2]` in any other function or context within this code snippet. Since there is no other function or variable to create a dependency with, we conclude that the specified variables are not data-dependent.
