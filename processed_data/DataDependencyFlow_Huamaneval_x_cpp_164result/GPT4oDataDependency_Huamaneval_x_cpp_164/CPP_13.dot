Label: no

Explanation: The IR code provided does not show any data dependency between the specified variables. The variable `%7`, which is derived from the `select` instruction using `%5` and `%4`, is only involved in operations within the function `@_Z23greatest_common_divisorii`, and there are no references to other functions or variables that would suggest a dependency on any variable from another function. Furthermore, both `%0` and `%1` are inputs to the function, and their usage does not create a dependency on each other nor on the output of the function. Thus, it can be concluded that the variables are not data-dependent.

DOT File Representation:
```
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    
    "[FUNCTION_NAME1]:[VAR_NAME1]" -> "[FUNCTION_NAME2]:[VAR_NAME2]" [label="no direct dependency"];
    "[FUNCTION_NAME1]" -> "[FUNCTION_NAME2]" [label="no function call"];
}
``` 

In this case, since there are no interactions between the two variables across different functions, the output indicates a clear lack of dependency.
