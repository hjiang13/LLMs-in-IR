Label: unknown

Explanation: The data dependency between the specified variables cannot be definitively determined due to the complexity of the IR code. While the code indicates the use of various variables, particularly in the context of pointer dereferencing and arithmetic operations, it lacks clarity regarding how the variables are passed between functions or how they relate to each other within the function's scope. For instance, the variables involved in the operations (such as `%13`, `%14`, etc.) are indirectly manipulated through multiple layers of operations, including `load`, `store`, and `bitcast`. However, without specific variable names or clarity on the exact variable locations in the provided code, it's unclear if there is a direct data dependency.
