Label: unknown

Explanation: The variables in question are not explicitly named in the provided IR code, making it impossible to directly track their dependencies. While the code shows multiple operations with various variables, without specific identifiers for [VAR_NAME1] and [VAR_NAME2], it's unclear if any dependencies exist between them. The data flow involves numerous loads and stores, but without identifying the specific variables in question, we cannot determine a clear data dependency.

DOT File Representation:
```
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    
    "Unknown VAR_NAME1" -> "Unknown VAR_NAME2" [label="unknown dependency"];
}
``` 

This representation acknowledges the absence of clear identifiers and the uncertainty regarding the dependency between the specified variables.
