**Label:** yes

**Explanation:** The variable `%32` in the function `@_Z3fibi` is data-dependent on the variable `%31`, which is also within the same function. This is evident from the operations that involve these variables. Specifically, `%31` is loaded from memory and then added to `%26` to compute `%32`:

```llvm
%31 = load i32, i32* %30, align 4, !tbaa !3
%32 = add nsw i32 %31, %26
```

The computation of `%32` directly uses the value loaded into `%31`, establishing a clear data dependency. Additionally, since both variables are within the same function, there are no cross-function complexities that could obscure the dependency.
