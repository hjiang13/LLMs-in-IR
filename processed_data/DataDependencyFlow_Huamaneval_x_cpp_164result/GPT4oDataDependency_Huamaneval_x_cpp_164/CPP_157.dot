Label: no

Explanation: The variable dependencies in the provided IR code show that the variables are not data-dependent on each other. In the function `_Z20right_angle_trianglefff`, the operations are performed only on the input parameters `%0`, `%1`, and `%2`. The calculations are independent of any other variables or states outside this function. There are no load or store operations that show any dependency on external variables, nor are there any function calls made that utilize or modify the variables in a way that would create a data dependency. Each variable contributes to the calculation within the function scope but does not depend on one another or on any external state.
