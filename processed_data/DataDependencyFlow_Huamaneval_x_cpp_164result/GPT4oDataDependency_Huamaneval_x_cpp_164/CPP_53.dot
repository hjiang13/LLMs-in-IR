Label: no

Explanation: In the provided IR code, the function `@_Z3addii` takes two parameters, `%0` and `%1`, and performs an addition operation to compute `%3`, which is then returned. Since there are no other functions or variables mentioned, there is no indication that any external variable (VAR_NAME2) is involved in the computation of the result or any subsequent operations. Therefore, `%0` and `%1` do not have a data dependency relationship with any other variables or states outside of this function.

DOT File Representation:
```  
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];

    "[FUNCTION_NAME1]:[VAR_NAME1]" -> "[FUNCTION_NAME2]:[VAR_NAME2]" [label="no dependency"];
}
``` 

Note: In this case, the function's variables are isolated and do not interact with any other function or variable, leading to a definitive conclusion of 'no' for data dependency.
