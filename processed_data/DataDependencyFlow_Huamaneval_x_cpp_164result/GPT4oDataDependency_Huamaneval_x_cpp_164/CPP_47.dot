Label: unknown

Explanation: The data dependency relationship between the specified variables in different functions cannot be determined conclusively based on the provided IR code. While there are multiple load and store operations evident in the code, the specific variables in the query are not defined or referenced in the provided code snippet. Without direct visibility into the variable names being queried, and without knowing the specific functions involved, it is not possible to ascertain whether a data dependency exists. The complexity of the IR, with various phi nodes and conditional branches, adds to the uncertainty, as dependencies could be indirect or obscured.

DOT File Representation:
```  
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];

    "unknown variable in FUNCTION_NAME1" -> "unknown variable in FUNCTION_NAME2" [label="unknown dependency"];
}
```
