Label: unknown

Explanation: The variable dependency relationship between [VAR_NAME1] and [VAR_NAME2] cannot be determined from the provided IR code. There are no explicit definitions or interactions involving named variables [VAR_NAME1] or [VAR_NAME2] in the given code. The IR shows a series of operations with specific variables (e.g., `%0`, `%1`, `%2`, etc.), but without knowing the actual names of [VAR_NAME1] and [VAR_NAME2] or their corresponding functions, we cannot definitively establish a data dependency. The lack of context around these variable names makes it unclear whether they are related or not.
