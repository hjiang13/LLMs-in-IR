Label: unknown

Explanation: In the provided IR code, the relationship between any specified variables (e.g., `VAR_NAME1` and `VAR_NAME2`) is not explicitly stated, making it challenging to determine data dependency. The code contains many operations involving various variables, but without specific references to `VAR_NAME1` and `VAR_NAME2`, we cannot definitively ascertain if there is a dependency. If `VAR_NAME1` is used in a computation that eventually leads to `VAR_NAME2`, or if both are influenced by the same global state, they might be dependent. However, the lack of direct references or clear paths connecting them limits our ability to make a definitive conclusion.

DOT File Representation:
```
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    
    "[FUNCTION_NAME1]:[VAR_NAME1]" -> "[FUNCTION_NAME2]:[VAR_NAME2]" [label="unknown dependency"];
    "[FUNCTION_NAME1]" -> "[FUNCTION_NAME2]" [label="function call"];
}
``` 

In this case, the dependency remains marked as "unknown" due to insufficient information about the specific variables in question and their interactions within the functions.
