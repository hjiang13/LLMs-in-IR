Label: unknown

Explanation: The query asks whether a variable from one function is data-dependent on a variable from another function. However, the provided IR code contains a complex function with multiple variables, and it does not clearly define either [FUNCTION_NAME1] or [FUNCTION_NAME2] in the context of the variables [VAR_NAME1] and [VAR_NAME2]. Moreover, the IR code does not have explicit references to these variable names, which makes it difficult to ascertain any potential data dependencies. The presence of indirect dependencies through multiple function calls, variable loads, and stores further complicates the analysis. Therefore, without specific variable names and a clearer context of their interactions, it is uncertain if a data dependency exists.

DOT File Representation:
```
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    
    "[FUNCTION_NAME1]:[VAR_NAME1]" -> "[FUNCTION_NAME2]:[VAR_NAME2]" [label="unknown dependency"];
}
