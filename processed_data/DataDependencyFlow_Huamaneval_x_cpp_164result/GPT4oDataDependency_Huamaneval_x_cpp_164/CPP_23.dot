Label: no

Explanation: The variable `%3` in the function `_Z6strlenNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE` is loaded from the pointer `%2`, which is derived from the input parameter `%0`. There is no indication that it is dependent on any variable from other functions in the current context. The operation performed on `%3` is a truncation to an `i32`, which does not involve any other variables outside this function. Therefore, there is no data dependency with any other variables from different functions, including `VAR_NAME2`, assuming it is not part of this function.
