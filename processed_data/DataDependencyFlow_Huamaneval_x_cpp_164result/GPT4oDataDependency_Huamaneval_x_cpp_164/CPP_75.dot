Label: unknown

Explanation: The analysis of the provided IR code reveals complex interdependencies among various variables, particularly through the use of `phi` nodes and multiple branches. However, without explicit names or values for [VAR_NAME1] and [VAR_NAME2], it's difficult to ascertain whether there is a direct data dependency between them. The `phi` nodes (e.g., `%4`, `%5`, `%6`, etc.) represent values that are selected based on control flow, which may or may not involve [VAR_NAME1] or [VAR_NAME2]. In scenarios where variables are determined through conditional logic or multiple paths (as seen in the use of `br` instructions), the relationships can be indirect or conditional, leading to uncertainty regarding their interdependence. Thus, we cannot definitively conclude whether [VAR_NAME1] is data-dependent on [VAR_NAME2].
