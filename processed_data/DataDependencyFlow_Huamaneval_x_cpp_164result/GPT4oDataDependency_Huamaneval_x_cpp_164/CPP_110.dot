Label: unknown

Explanation: The dependency relationship between the specified variables is unclear due to the complexity of the Intermediate Representation (IR) code. While there are several load and store operations present, it is challenging to definitively trace the dependencies without more explicit context on the specific variables and functions being referenced. The functions interact through various operations (like calls to `llvm.umax.i64`, loads, and stores), but without knowing the exact variables in question and their specific usage in both functions, it is uncertain if a direct data dependency exists. Indirect dependencies through multiple variables or function calls could exist but are not explicitly clear from the IR provided.

DOT File Representation:
```  
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    
    "[FUNCTION_NAME1]:[VAR_NAME1]" -> "[FUNCTION_NAME2]:[VAR_NAME2]" [label="unknown dependency"];
}
