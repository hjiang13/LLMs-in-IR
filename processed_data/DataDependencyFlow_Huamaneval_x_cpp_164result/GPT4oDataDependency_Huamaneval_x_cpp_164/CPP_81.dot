Label: unknown

Explanation: The determination of data dependency between variables from different functions is complicated due to the lack of clear visibility into the complete data flows and interactions. In the provided IR code, while there are multiple variable definitions, loads, and stores, it's unclear if the specific variables in question are directly influencing one another without seeing the complete context for [VAR_NAME1] and [VAR_NAME2]. They could be indirectly related through shared inputs or outputs, but this cannot be confirmed without additional information. Therefore, the dependency relationship is categorized as unknown.

DOT File Representation:
```  
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    
    "[FUNCTION_NAME1]:[VAR_NAME1]" -> "[FUNCTION_NAME2]:[VAR_NAME2]" [label="dependency unknown"];
}
```
