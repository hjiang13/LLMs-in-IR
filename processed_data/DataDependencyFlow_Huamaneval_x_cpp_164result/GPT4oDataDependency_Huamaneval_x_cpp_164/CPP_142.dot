Label: unknown

Explanation: The variable dependencies are unclear due to the nature of the operations and the lack of explicit definitions for the variables in the provided code. We do not have specific variable names to analyze, and the IR code doesn't indicate direct data dependencies between any two variables without further context about their initialization or use outside of this provided function. The operations present (loads, arithmetic, and branching) suggest potential for data dependency, but without naming or specific referencing of the variables, we cannot definitively state that they are data-dependent.

DOT File Representation:
```
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];

    "Function:_Z11sum_squaresSt6vectorIiSaIiEE:VAR_NAME1" -> "Function:_Z11sum_squaresSt6vectorIiSaIiEE:VAR_NAME2" [label="unknown dependency"];
    "Function:_Z11sum_squaresSt6vectorIiSaIiEE" [label="Function with unknown dependencies"];
}
``` 

This representation indicates that we have an uncertain relationship between variables, reflecting the ambiguity of the data flow based on the provided IR code.
