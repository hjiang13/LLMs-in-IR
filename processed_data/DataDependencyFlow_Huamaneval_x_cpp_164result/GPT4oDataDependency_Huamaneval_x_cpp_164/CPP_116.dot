Label: unknown

Explanation: The variables in question are not explicitly referenced in the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code. We cannot ascertain their data dependency relationship without additional context or definitions for [VAR_NAME1] and [VAR_NAME2]. While the code contains various loads and stores that affect multiple variables, without specific names or clear connections provided for the variables in question, it is impossible to definitively determine if they are data-dependent. There may be indirect dependencies through other variables, but without further details, we label this as 'unknown'.

DOT File Representation:
```
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    
    "[FUNCTION_NAME1]:[VAR_NAME1]" -> "[FUNCTION_NAME2]:[VAR_NAME2]" [label="unknown dependency"];
}
```
