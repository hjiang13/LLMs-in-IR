**Label:** unknown

**Explanation:** The analysis of the provided IR code shows that there are no direct assignments or calculations involving the same variables across different functions (or even within the same function). The function `_Z13triangle_areafff` uses three input variables (`%0`, `%1`, `%2`) and computes various intermediate results based on these inputs. However, there is no mention or definition of variables from a different function that could indicate a dependency. Since no specific variable names (e.g., `VAR_NAME1`, `VAR_NAME2`) are provided in the query, and there are no interactions between functions in the visible code, it's unclear if any variables across functions have a dependency relationship. Thus, the answer is labeled as "unknown".

**DOT File Representation:**
```  
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];

    "[_Z13triangle_areafff]:[%0]" -> "[_Z13triangle_areafff]:[%1]" [label="used in calculations"];
    "[_Z13triangle_areafff]:[%1]" -> "[_Z13triangle_areafff]:[%2]" [label="used in calculations"];
    "[_Z13triangle_areafff]:[%2]" -> "[_Z13triangle_areafff]:[%0]" [label="used in calculations"];
}
``` 

This graph shows that there are operations within the function that rely on the inputs, but since there is no interaction with other functions or defined variables, it remains unclear if any dependencies exist outside of the local context.
