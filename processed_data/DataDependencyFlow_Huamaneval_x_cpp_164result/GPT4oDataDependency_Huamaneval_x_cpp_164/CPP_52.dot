Label: unknown

Explanation: The variable dependencies in the provided IR code are complex, and while it is possible that certain variables may indirectly depend on each other, the specific relationship between the two queried variables is not explicitly laid out in the code. The IR code contains various operations such as loads, stores, and arithmetic computations, and while it's clear that there are operations that involve loading values from certain pointers, without the names of the specific variables and their context in the IR, it's difficult to assert a clear data dependency. The code does indicate multiple uses of values derived from the same vector, but without explicit variable names or a clear indication of how they relate to each other, the answer remains uncertain.

DOT File Representation:
```  
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];

    "[FUNCTION_NAME1]:[VAR_NAME1]" -> "[FUNCTION_NAME2]:[VAR_NAME2]" [label="unknown dependency"];
    "[FUNCTION_NAME1]" -> "[FUNCTION_NAME2]" [label="function interaction"];
}
``` 

In this case, the dependency could be inferred based on the flow of data, but due to the lack of explicit information about the variables in question, the dependency relationship cannot be definitively established.
