To analyze the data dependency relationship between the specified variables in the given IR code, we need to consider the operations performed on the variables and the flow of data through them.

### Label: no

### Explanation:
In the provided IR code, we are looking for a data dependency between two variables across the same function, which is `_Z3eatiii`. The function operates on a `std::vector` and several `i32` integers. However, upon reviewing the operations, it is clear that the variables manipulated within this function do not show direct dependency on each other. 

The variables appear to perform independent calculations and store results in separate memory locations without any read/write interaction that would suggest a data dependency. For example, the operations like `add`, `sub`, and `store` are carried out on different variables such as `%1`, `%2`, and `%3` without overlapping data, and the storage of results does not affect the inputs of other calculations. 

Thus, without any direct assignments or shared memory locations being read or modified based on each other, we conclude that there is no data dependency between the two variables in question.

### DOT File Representation:
```  
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];

    "[_Z3eatiii]:[VAR_NAME1]" -> "[_Z3eatiii]:[VAR_NAME2]" [label="no dependency"];
}
```

### Additional Considerations:
- The operations primarily involve arithmetic and memory management specific to vector manipulation, which are independent.
- There are no function calls that would link the two variables across different contexts, reinforcing that they do not share data dependencies.

In summary, based on the operations and data flow in the provided IR code, the relationship between the specified variables is marked as 'no'.
