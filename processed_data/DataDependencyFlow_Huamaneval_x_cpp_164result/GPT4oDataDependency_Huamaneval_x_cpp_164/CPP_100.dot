Label: unknown

Explanation: The variable `%17` in the function `@_Z11make_a_pilei` is a pointer to an integer (`i32*`) that is involved in multiple operations, including conditional branches and stores. However, it is not clear whether it is dependent on another variable directly from the provided IR code. Without additional context about the flow of data to and from `VAR_NAME2`, we can't definitively establish a data dependency. If `VAR_NAME2` is involved in calculations or operations that affect the value of `%17`, then there may be a dependency, but that is not explicitly shown in the code snippet provided.
