Label: no

Explanation: In the provided IR code, the variables are `%0`, `%1`, and other intermediate variables like `%3`, `%4`, `%6`, etc. The code defines a function `@_Z15is_simple_powerii` which takes two integer parameters, `%0` and `%1`. However, there is no indication that any variable in this function directly uses or modifies any variables from another function, since there is only one function defined here. Thus, there are no data dependencies between any two specified variables (VAR_NAME1 and VAR_NAME2), as they belong to the same function context and no cross-function data flow is indicated.

DOT File Representation:
```
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];

    "[FUNCTION_NAME1]:[VAR_NAME1]" -> "[FUNCTION_NAME2]:[VAR_NAME2]" [label="no direct dependency"];
}
``` 

In this case, since no specific variable names were provided nor details about how they are related across functions, I could not establish a dependency relationship. Hence, the result is labeled as 'no'.
