Explanation: The Intermediate Representation code provided does not contain explicit references to two distinct variables named [VAR_NAME1] in [FUNCTION_NAME1] and [VAR_NAME2] in [FUNCTION_NAME2]. The operations present involve several transformations and computations within a single function, specifically in the function `@_Z7iscuberi(i32 %0)`. The variable `%4` is defined from a `phi` instruction, which is influenced by control flow, and the variable `%6` is computed from `%5`, which in turn is derived from `%4`. However, without specific variable names to analyze or compare across different functions, we cannot definitively conclude if a data dependency exists between two specified variables. The analysis is limited by the lack of clarity and specificity in the variable names and functions in the query.

DOT File Representation:
```
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    
    // Since we don't have specific variables or functions to connect, we leave the graph empty.
}
