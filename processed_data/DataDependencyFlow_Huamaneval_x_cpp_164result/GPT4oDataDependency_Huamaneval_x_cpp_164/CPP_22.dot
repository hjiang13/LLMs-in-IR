Label: unknown

Explanation: The variables in question are not explicitly defined in the provided IR code. Without explicit variable names or clear function definitions, it is impossible to determine if there is a data dependency relationship between them. The code contains various structures and functions, but without specific references to `[VAR_NAME1]` and `[VAR_NAME2]` in `[FUNCTION_NAME1]` and `[FUNCTION_NAME2]`, it's unclear whether they interact directly or indirectly. As a result, the analysis of their dependency is inconclusive.

DOT File Representation:
```
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    
    "[FUNCTION_NAME1]:[VAR_NAME1]" -> "[FUNCTION_NAME2]:[VAR_NAME2]" [label="unknown dependency"];
}
``` 

This output reflects the uncertainty regarding the data dependency between the specified variables across the specified functions, given the lack of concrete references in the provided code snippet.
