Label: no

Explanation: In the provided IR code, there is no indication that the variables in the function `_Z10choose_numii` (which corresponds to `choose_num`) have any data dependency with each other. The function takes two integer parameters `%0` and `%1`, performs various comparisons and arithmetic operations on them, but there is no evidence of any interaction with variables from another function or shared state that would create a data dependency. Each operation within the function is self-contained, and there is no indication of shared variables or return values that would link them to another function. Therefore, I conclude that the variables are not data-dependent.

DOT File Representation:
```  
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    
    "[choose_num]:[%0]" -> "[choose_num]:[%1]" [label="no direct dependency"];
    "[choose_num]" [label="Function only"];
}
