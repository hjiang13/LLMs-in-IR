Label: unknown

Explanation: The provided IR code does not clearly indicate the relationship between the specified variables, as there is no explicit mention of them in the code. Without knowing the specific variables [VAR_NAME1] and [VAR_NAME2] and their roles in the program, it is impossible to ascertain whether there is a data dependency between them. The IR code displays a complex flow with multiple variables and function calls, but without specific variable names or context, the dependency relationship remains unclear.

DOT File Representation:
```  
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    
    "Function:_Z15check_dict_caseSt3map" -> "Unknown:VAR_NAME1" [label="unknown dependency"];
    "Function:_Z15check_dict_caseSt3map" -> "Unknown:VAR_NAME2" [label="unknown dependency"];
}
``` 

This representation highlights the uncertainty regarding the relationships due to the lack of specific variable identifiers.
