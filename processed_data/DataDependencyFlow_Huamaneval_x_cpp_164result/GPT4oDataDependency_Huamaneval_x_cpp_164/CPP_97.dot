Label: no

Explanation: The variable `%0` in the function `_Z8multiplyii` is not data-dependent on the variable `%1` in the same function. The function takes two integer inputs, `%0` and `%1`, applies the `llvm.abs.i32` function to both to get their absolute values, and then calculates two separate remainders (`%4` and `%6`) based on the values of `%0` and `%1`. The final result is computed using these two independent remainders in the multiplication operation `%7`. Since the operations on `%0` and `%1` do not influence each other directly or indirectly, there is no data dependency between them.
