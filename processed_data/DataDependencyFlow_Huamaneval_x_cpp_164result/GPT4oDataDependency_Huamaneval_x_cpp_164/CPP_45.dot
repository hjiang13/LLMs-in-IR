Label: no

Explanation: In the provided IR code, the function `_Z13triangle_areaff` takes two float arguments, `%0` and `%1`, and performs calculations using those arguments. The calculations involve multiplying `%0` and `%1` to produce an intermediate result `%3`, which is then further used to produce the final result `%4` that is returned. There are no references to any other functions or variables in this snippet that would indicate a dependency between variables across different functions. Since the query lacks context about any other functions or variables, it can be concluded that there is no data dependency between any variables as per the given IR code.
