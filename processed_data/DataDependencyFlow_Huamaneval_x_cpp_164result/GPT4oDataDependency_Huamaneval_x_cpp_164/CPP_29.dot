Explanation: The variable relationships between the functions in the provided IR code are complex and intertwined. Without specific variable names to analyze (in your query, the placeholders [VAR_NAME1], [FUNCTION_NAME1], [VAR_NAME2], and [FUNCTION_NAME2] were used), a concrete determination cannot be made. There are multiple variables being loaded, stored, and manipulated within various functions, and the dependencies could be indirect or through intermediate states. For example, the variables in question may be passed as arguments to functions or modified within other operations, which complicates the analysis. Given this, we cannot definitively ascertain the data dependency without clearer context or specific variable references.

DOT File Representation:
```  
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    
    // Placeholder for variable dependency; specific functions and variables need to be identified
    "[FUNCTION_NAME1]:[VAR_NAME1]" -> "[FUNCTION_NAME2]:[VAR_NAME2]" [label="unknown dependency"];
}
``` 

**Note:** For a more precise answer, please provide specific variable names and function names you are interested in analyzing for data dependencies.
