Label: unknown

Explanation: The IR code provided does not contain any explicit information about the names of the variables or functions involved. As such, we cannot definitively ascertain whether the variable [VAR_NAME1] in [FUNCTION_NAME1] has a data dependency on [VAR_NAME2] in [FUNCTION_NAME2]. Furthermore, the operations in the function `_Z8is_primex(i64 %0)` reference local variables and parameters, but there is no indication of interactions with another distinct function or variable outside this context. Therefore, without additional context or information about the specific variables and functions referenced in the query, the dependency relationship remains unclear.

DOT File Representation:
```  
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    
    "[FUNCTION_NAME1]:[VAR_NAME1]" -> "[FUNCTION_NAME2]:[VAR_NAME2]" [label="unknown dependency"];
}
```
