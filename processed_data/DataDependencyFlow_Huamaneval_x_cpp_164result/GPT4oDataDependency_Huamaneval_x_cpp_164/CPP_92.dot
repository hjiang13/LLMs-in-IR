Label: unknown

Explanation: In the given IR code, we have variables related to floating-point numbers and their operations within a single function `@_Z7any_intfff`. Without specific names for `[VAR_NAME1]` and `[VAR_NAME2]`, we cannot definitively establish a data dependency relationship. The variables `%0`, `%1`, and `%2` are used in calculations, and their results are passed through various operations (like `fadd`, `fcmp`, and `select`). However, since the query does not specify which variables we are analyzing for dependency and since they all seem to be calculated independently without clear indication of their relationship across function calls or through shared memory, we cannot ascertain a direct data dependency.

DOT File Representation:
```
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    
    "[FUNCTION_NAME1]:[VAR_NAME1]" -> "[FUNCTION_NAME2]:[VAR_NAME2]" [label="unknown dependency"];
    "[FUNCTION_NAME1]" -> "[FUNCTION_NAME2]" [label="function call"];
}
``` 

Additional Consideration: More context or specific variable names would help clarify the relationship. In this case, any dependency would be indirect and dependent on the use of common inputs (`%0`, `%1`, `%2`) without clear tracing. Therefore, it remains labeled as 'unknown'.
