**Label:** unknown

**Explanation:** The relationship between the variables in the specified functions is unclear due to the complexity of the Intermediate Representation (IR) provided. The IR contains many function definitions and operations, but without specific variable names or function names specified in your query, it's difficult to ascertain any direct or indirect dependencies. The presence of various data structures like vectors, pairs, and maps suggests potential interactions, but without concrete identifiers (like `VAR_NAME1`, `FUNCTION_NAME1`, `VAR_NAME2`, `FUNCTION_NAME2`), we cannot determine a definitive data dependency.

**DOT File Representation:**
```  
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    
    "unknown function: unknown variable" -> "unknown function: unknown variable" [label="unknown dependency"];
}
``` 

This output reflects the uncertainty surrounding the variables' dependencies due to the lack of specific details regarding their identities or the functions they belong to. If you can provide specific variable names and function names, a more accurate evaluation can be made.
