Explanation: The variable `%10` in the function `@_Z12add_elementsSt6vectorIiSaIiEEi` is not data-dependent on the variable `%1` in the same function. The variable `%10` is derived from the operation `add nuw nsw i64 %12, 1`, where `%12` is computed from a series of earlier operations, but does not directly use `%1`. Similarly, `%1` is only used in a comparison operation (`icmp sgt i32 %1, 0`) and does not influence the calculation of `%10`. Therefore, there is no direct or indirect dependency established between these two variables.
