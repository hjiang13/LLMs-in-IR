Label: unknown

Explanation: The analysis of the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code shows numerous variables and states, with multiple potential interactions. However, without specific variable names or functions to analyze the dependency relationship between, it's unclear if any two variables (VAR_NAME1 and VAR_NAME2) are directly data-dependent. The IR code is complex and involves many operations across functions, making it difficult to determine a specific relationship without explicit references to the variables in question. If the variables were specified, I could examine their interactions more closely.
