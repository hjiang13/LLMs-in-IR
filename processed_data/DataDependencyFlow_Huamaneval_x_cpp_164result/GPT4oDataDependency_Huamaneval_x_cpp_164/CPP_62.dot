Label: unknown

Explanation: The data dependency between the specified variables is unclear due to the complexity of the intermediate representation and the indirect nature of their interactions. The IR code does not provide sufficient context to determine if [VAR_NAME1] in [FUNCTION_NAME1] directly depends on [VAR_NAME2] in [FUNCTION_NAME2]. While there are operations involving loading and storing values, the lack of explicit connections or operations between the two variables makes it difficult to assert a direct dependency. There could potentially be indirect dependencies through other variables or the values being manipulated before reaching the points of interest.

DOT File Representation:
```  
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    
    "[FUNCTION_NAME1]:[VAR_NAME1]" -> "[FUNCTION_NAME2]:[VAR_NAME2]" [label="unknown dependency"];
}
```
