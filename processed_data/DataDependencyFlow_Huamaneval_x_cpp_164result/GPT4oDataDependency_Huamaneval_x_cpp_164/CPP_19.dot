**Label**: unknown

**Explanation**: The determination of whether the variable in one function is data-dependent on a variable in another function is complex in the context of the provided IR code. The code exhibits extensive interactions between data structures such as maps and strings, with multiple calls to functions that manipulate these data structures. 

While we can see that certain variables are being passed around and manipulated, the lack of explicit variable names makes it difficult to establish a direct data dependency between two specified variables from two different functions. Moreover, there are many layers of function calls and data transformations, which could introduce indirect dependencies not clearly visible without further context. Due to this complexity and the absence of explicit references to the variables in question, we cannot definitively conclude whether a data dependency exists.

**DOT File Representation**:
```  
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    
    "[FUNCTION_NAME1]:[VAR_NAME1]" -> "[FUNCTION_NAME2]:[VAR_NAME2]" [label="unknown dependency"];
    "[FUNCTION_NAME1]" -> "[FUNCTION_NAME2]" [label="function interaction"];
}
``` 

This representation indicates a potential interaction between the two functions but does not assert a clear dependency due to the reasons outlined above. Further investigation would be required to clarify the relationships between the specific variables and their states across the functions.
