Label: unknown

Explanation: The analysis of data dependency between variables in the provided IR code is complicated by the lack of explicit information on which variables to compare. The code includes a series of operations and function calls, where variables may be modified, used, or passed around in complex ways. Without specific variable names or functions to analyze, it's difficult to determine a clear data dependency relationship. There are various loads, stores, and arithmetic operations involving multiple variables, but without a defined context for [VAR_NAME1] and [VAR_NAME2], we cannot definitively conclude if a data dependency exists. The dependency may be indirect or reliant on the specific contexts of variable usage that are not stated in the query.
