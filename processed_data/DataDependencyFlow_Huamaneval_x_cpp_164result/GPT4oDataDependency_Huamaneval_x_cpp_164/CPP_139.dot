**Label:** unknown

**Explanation:** The variables in question cannot be definitively assessed for a data dependency without specific information on which variables are being compared. In the provided IR code, there are numerous variables used, but without knowing the exact names or nature of `[VAR_NAME1]` and `[VAR_NAME2]`, we cannot state whether they are data-dependent. The code features various operations like additions, multiplications, and comparisons across different blocks, but the dependencies are complex due to the presence of multiple phi nodes and conditionals. There are potential indirect dependencies through these operations that make it unclear whether there is a direct data dependency between the specified variables.

**DOT File Representation:**
```  
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    
    "unknown:VAR_NAME1" -> "unknown:VAR_NAME2" [label="unknown dependency"];
}
``` 

This representation reflects the uncertainty regarding the relationship between the two variables, as we do not have specific identifiers for them in the context of the provided IR code.
