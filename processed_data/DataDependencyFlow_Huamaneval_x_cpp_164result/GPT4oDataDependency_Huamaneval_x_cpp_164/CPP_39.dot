Label: no

Explanation: The variable `%4` in the function `@_Z9prime_fibi` (which corresponds to `VAR_NAME1` in the query) does not have a data dependency on the variable `%22` (which corresponds to `VAR_NAME2` in the query) as there is no direct use or assignment of one variable based on the other. In the provided IR code, `%4` is defined using the `phi` instruction and is used in various calculations, while `%22` is also defined independently using a `phi` instruction and is involved in a separate calculation. There are no operations that show `%4` depending on `%22`, so the conclusion is there is no data dependency between them.

DOT File Representation:
```
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    
    "[FUNCTION_NAME1]:[VAR_NAME1]" -> "[FUNCTION_NAME1]:[VAR_NAME2]" [label="no direct dependency"];
}
``` 

In this representation, since both variables are part of the same function and do not influence each other, the graph shows no direct dependency.
