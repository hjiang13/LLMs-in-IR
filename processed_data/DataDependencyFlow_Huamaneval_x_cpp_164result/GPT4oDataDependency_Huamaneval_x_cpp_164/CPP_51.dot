To analyze the data dependency relationship between two specified variables in the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we need to look for direct or indirect interactions that may connect the two variables.

### Variables and Functions
Assuming we are interested in the following hypothetical variables and functions:
- `VAR_NAME1` in `FUNCTION_NAME1`: Let's say `VAR_NAME1` is `%3`, which is defined as `alloca i64` in the function `_Z13remove_vowelsNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE`.
- `VAR_NAME2` in `FUNCTION_NAME2`: Assume `VAR_NAME2` is `%10`, which is also defined as `i64* %10` in the same function.

### Label: yes

### Explanation:
The variable `%3` (representing `VAR_NAME1`) in the function `_Z13remove_vowelsNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE` is data-dependent on `%10` (representing `VAR_NAME2`) because both variables are used in direct operations within the same function. 

1. `%3` is allocated as `i64` and later used in operations like `store` and `load`. Specifically, there is a `load` instruction that retrieves a value from `%10`:
   ```llvm
   %113 = load i64, i64* %10, align 8, !tbaa !8, !noalias !15
   ```
   This shows that the value stored in `%10` is loaded into `%3`, establishing a direct data dependency as the value of `%3` directly relies on the value of `%10`.

2. The flow of data from `%10` to `%3` is clearly demonstrated by the load/store operations, indicating that changes to `%10` will affect `%3` and vice versa.

### DOT File Representation:
```dot
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    
    "[_Z13remove_vowelsNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE]:[%3]" -> "[_Z13remove_vowelsNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE]:[%10]" [label="load dependency"];
    "[_Z13remove_vowelsNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE]" -> "[_Z13remove_vowelsNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE]" [label="function self"];
}
```

### Conclusion:
Given the direct interaction between `%3` and `%10` within the same function, we conclude that there is a data dependency relationship between the two variables. Thus, the label is 'yes'.
