**Label:** unknown

**Explanation:** In the provided IR code, the variables in question are not specified. However, based on the complexity of the code and the presence of various operations such as loads, stores, and arithmetic calculations, it's challenging to ascertain data dependency without knowing which specific variables (e.g., `%5`, `%13`, etc.) are being considered. There are multiple control flow paths and potential indirect dependencies through intermediate variables that could exist, making it unclear if any two specified variables are directly data-dependent.

**DOT File Representation:**
```  
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    
    // No specific variables given, so general representation
    "unknown variable in FUNCTION_NAME1" -> "unknown variable in FUNCTION_NAME2" [label="dependency unclear"];
    "FUNCTION_NAME1" -> "FUNCTION_NAME2" [label="function call"];
}
``` 

In this representation, we acknowledge the lack of specifics regarding the variables by labeling them as unknown, reflecting the uncertainty regarding their dependencies.
