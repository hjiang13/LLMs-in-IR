**Label:** unknown

**Explanation:** The data dependency between the variables in question cannot be definitively established based on the provided IR code. This uncertainty arises because the specific variables (VAR_NAME1 and VAR_NAME2) were not explicitly defined in the query. 

However, analyzing the IR code, there are several instances of data manipulation through loads and stores, particularly with variables like `%3`, `%4`, `%5`, and `%6`. For example, the values stored in these variables can be dependent on each other through operations like `store`, `load`, `add`, and `icmp`. Without knowing the specific context of VAR_NAME1 and VAR_NAME2, we cannot confirm a direct relationship or dependency. They might be indirectly related through other variables or states, leading to an "unknown" classification for their dependency relationship.

**DOT File Representation:**
```
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];

    "Unknown:VAR_NAME1" -> "Unknown:VAR_NAME2" [label="unknown dependency"];
}
``` 

This representation indicates that without explicit variable names, we cannot ascertain a definitive data dependency relationship.
