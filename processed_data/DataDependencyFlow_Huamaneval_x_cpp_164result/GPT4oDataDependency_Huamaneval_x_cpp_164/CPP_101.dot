Label: unknown

Explanation: It is unclear if the variable [VAR_NAME1] in the function [FUNCTION_NAME1] is data-dependent on the variable [VAR_NAME2] in the function [FUNCTION_NAME2] because the provided IR code lacks specific variable names or function definitions that directly match the query. There are many variables and function calls in the provided code, but without knowing the specific names or context of the variables in question, we cannot definitively ascertain the data dependency. The IR shows complex operations involving multiple variables, but without explicit references to [VAR_NAME1] and [VAR_NAME2], we cannot establish a clear dependency.

DOT File Representation:
```
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    "unknown:VAR_NAME1" -> "unknown:VAR_NAME2" [label="unclear dependency"];
}
