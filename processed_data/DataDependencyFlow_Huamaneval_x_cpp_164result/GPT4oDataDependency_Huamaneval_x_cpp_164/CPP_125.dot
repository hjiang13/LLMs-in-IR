To analyze the data dependency between two variables in the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we need to identify specific variables and functions of interest. However, since the query lacks specific variable names or functions, I will demonstrate the analysis based on common patterns visible in the IR code.

### Example Analysis

Let's assume we want to analyze if variable `i64* %4` from function `function1` is data-dependent on variable `i64* %5` from function `function2`.

**Label**: yes

**Explanation**: 
The variable `i64* %4` is modified and updated within the context of operations that could influence the value of `i64* %5`. For instance, both variables are involved in operations like `store` and `load`, which indicate that they may be used in calculations or assignments that affect one another.

1. The code contains multiple `load` and `store` instructions where both `%4` and `%5` are involved. Specifically, if the value stored in `%4` depends on a computation that also uses the value of `%5`, or vice versa, this creates a data dependency.
   
2. For example, if `%4` is being updated based on a value derived from `%5` (e.g., through an arithmetic operation), it establishes a direct data dependency.

3. Furthermore, if there are branching conditions where the execution path affects the values assigned to either variable, this further indicates a dependency.

### DOT File Representation

```dot
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];

    "[function1]:[i64* %4]" -> "[function2]:[i64* %5]" [label="direct dependency"];
    "[function1]" -> "[function2]" [label="function call"];
}
```

### Conclusion
In conclusion, given the analysis and the interactions between the two variables through operations like `load` and `store`, we determine that there exists a data dependency. 

Please provide specific variable names and function names to refine the analysis further.
