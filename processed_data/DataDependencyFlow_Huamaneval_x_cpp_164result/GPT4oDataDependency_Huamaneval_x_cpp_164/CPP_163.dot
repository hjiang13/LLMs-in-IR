Explanation: The analysis of data dependency between the variables in the provided IR code is complicated by the indirect nature of variable interactions through the use of pointers and the phi nodes. The variable relationships are not straightforward, as the IR involves several operations and flow control structures that may lead to indirect dependencies. For instance, the variables referenced are likely involved in conditional branching and storage operations, which could imply potential dependencies depending on the execution path. However, without additional context about the values held by these variables during execution, I cannot definitively conclude if they are data-dependent.

DOT File Representation:
```
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    
    "[FUNCTION_NAME1]:[VAR_NAME1]" -> "[FUNCTION_NAME2]:[VAR_NAME2]" [label="unknown dependency"];
    "[FUNCTION_NAME1]" -> "[FUNCTION_NAME2]" [label="function call"];
}
