**Label**: unknown

**Explanation**: The analysis of the provided IR code does not allow us to definitively conclude whether the variable [VAR_NAME1] from a specified function is data-dependent on [VAR_NAME2] from another function due to the complexity of the IR code and the absence of clear identifiers for these variables. The IR code includes multiple functions with multiple variables, and without specific names for [VAR_NAME1] and [VAR_NAME2], it's unclear how these variables interact. There are several instances of variables being passed around as arguments and manipulated through various load, store, and function call operations. However, without exact variable names, we cannot ascertain a direct data dependency or the necessary interactions between the two variables.

**DOT File Representation**:
```
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    
    // Placeholder for unknown dependencies
    "Unknown Variable 1" -> "Unknown Variable 2" [label="data dependency unclear"];
    "Unknown Function 1" -> "Unknown Function 2" [label="function interaction"];
}
``` 

In this representation, "Unknown Variable 1" and "Unknown Variable 2" serve as placeholders for the variables in question, and it notes the uncertainty regarding their data dependency relationship. The functions are also represented generically to indicate potential interactions without specific identification.
