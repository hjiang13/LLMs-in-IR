Label: unknown

Explanation: It is unclear if the specified variables [VAR_NAME1] and [VAR_NAME2] have a data dependency relationship because the provided IR code does not specify the exact names of the variables in question nor their corresponding functions. The code shows numerous variable manipulations, function calls, and control flow that could involve various dependencies. However, without specific variable names and the functions they belong to, we cannot definitively conclude their dependency status. The complexity of the IR and potential indirect dependencies through multiple transformations make it hard to ascertain a clear relationship.
