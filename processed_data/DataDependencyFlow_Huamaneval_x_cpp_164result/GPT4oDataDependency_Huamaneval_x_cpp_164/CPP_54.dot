Label: unknown

Explanation: The analysis of the provided IR code does not provide enough information to definitively determine the data dependency relationship between the specified variables, as their names are not given. The code involves complex interactions between structures and pointers, and the dependencies may arise through indirect means (e.g., through the use of pointers, loads, or stores). While some variables may seem to reference others, without the specific variable names or a clear understanding of their context within the function calls and data flows, the exact nature of the dependency remains indeterminate.

In the provided code, there are many layers of pointer dereferencing and conditional branches that could lead to indirect dependencies. For example, variables are loaded from memory and then used in comparisons or further calculations, but whether any two specific variables are interdependent cannot be ascertained without explicit names.

DOT File Representation:
```
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    
    "Function_1:VAR_NAME1" -> "Function_2:VAR_NAME2" [label="unknown dependency"];
    "Function_1" -> "Function_2" [label="function interaction"];
}
``` 

In this representation, I have used placeholders for the variable names and functions as the specific queries were not provided, emphasizing the lack of clarity regarding the relationships. Further information would be required to provide a more conclusive answer.
