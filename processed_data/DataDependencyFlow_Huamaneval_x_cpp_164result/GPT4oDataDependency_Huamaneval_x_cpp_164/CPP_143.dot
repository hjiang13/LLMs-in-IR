Label: unknown

Explanation: The data dependency between the specified variables is unclear due to the complex interactions in the provided IR code. Although the IR code shows multiple variables being manipulated, it does not provide explicit evidence of direct dependencies between the two variables in question. The variables might interact through several layers of function calls and intermediate variables, which can obscure the direct relationship. The presence of multiple instructions and the potential for indirect dependencies make it difficult to ascertain a clear data dependency solely based on the given code snippet.

DOT File Representation:
```
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    
    "[FUNCTION_NAME1]:[VAR_NAME1]" -> "[FUNCTION_NAME2]:[VAR_NAME2]" [label="unknown dependency"];
    "[FUNCTION_NAME1]" -> "[FUNCTION_NAME2]" [label="function call"];
}
``` 

In this case, without specific variable names and function contexts to analyze, we cannot definitively say whether there is a dependency, thus resulting in an 'unknown' label.
