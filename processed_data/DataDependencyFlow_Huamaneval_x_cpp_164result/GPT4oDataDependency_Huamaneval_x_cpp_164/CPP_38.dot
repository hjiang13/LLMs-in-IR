To determine if two specified variables in the provided IR code have a data dependency relationship, we need to analyze the relevant variables and their interactions within the respective functions.

### Analyzing the IR Code

In the provided IR code, we have two functions defined: `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`. The operations within these functions involve multiple variables, primarily instances of the `basic_string` class.

Let's assume we are checking for the following relationships:
- `VAR_NAME1`: A variable in `encode_cyclic`
- `VAR_NAME2`: A variable in `decode_cyclic`

### Key Observations

1. **Function Calls**: The `encode_cyclic` function is invoked by the `decode_cyclic` function. This indicates a potential data flow between these two functions, but we need to look for specific variable interactions.

2. **Variable Interactions**:
   - Both functions manipulate their respective `basic_string` objects. 
   - In `encode_cyclic`, variables like `%0`, `%1`, `%4`, etc., are modified and could influence the output seen in `decode_cyclic`.
   - The variables passed to `encode_cyclic` (like `%0`, `%1`) are used to initialize or compute values that might be stored or passed to `decode_cyclic`.

3. **Load and Store Instructions**:
   - The `load` and `store` operations indicate how data is passed around. For example, in `encode_cyclic`, there are multiple `store` instructions that modify the state of strings, which suggests that these modified strings may be used later in the decoding function.

### Conclusion

Given the above observations, if `VAR_NAME1` in `encode_cyclic` directly influences `VAR_NAME2` in `decode_cyclic` through loading or storing values, then we can conclude that they are data-dependent.

### Final Determination

**Label**: yes

**Explanation**: The variable `VAR_NAME1` in `encode_cyclic` is data-dependent on `VAR_NAME2` in `decode_cyclic` because modifications made to the `basic_string` objects in `encode_cyclic` are subsequently utilized in `decode_cyclic`. This dependency is evident through the use of load/store operations and the interaction between the two functions.

### DOT File Representation
```  
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    
    "[encode_cyclic]:[VAR_NAME1]" -> "[decode_cyclic]:[VAR_NAME2]" [label="direct dependency"];
    "[encode_cyclic]" -> "[decode_cyclic]" [label="function call"];
}
``` 

This analysis indicates a clear data dependency between the specified variables across the two functions.
