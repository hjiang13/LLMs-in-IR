**Label:** unknown

**Explanation:** In the provided IR code, there are multiple variables involved, but the specific variables of interest are not defined in the query. Since there is no clear mention of what [VAR_NAME1] and [VAR_NAME2] refer to in the context of the functions, it's difficult to ascertain whether any data dependency exists. The code contains several operations; however, without knowing which specific variables are being compared, we can't definitively determine if a data dependency exists.

The code has variables that may potentially interact (like `%0`, `%1`, `%11`, etc.), but without explicitly naming the variables in question, we cannot confirm a direct or indirect dependency. The presence of multiple phi nodes and branching logic adds to the complexity, leaving the dependency relationship ambiguous.

**DOT File Representation:**
```  
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    
    "Function:_Z4modpii" -> "Variables: %0, %1, %3, %5, %6, %11, %12, %15, %16, %18, %19, %22" [label="multiple potential dependencies"];
    "Function:_Z4modpii" -> "Final Output: %22" [label="returns"];
}
``` 

In this representation, the function `_Z4modpii` is shown to have multiple variables that could potentially be related, but without specific variable names, the exact nature of the dependencies remains unclear.
