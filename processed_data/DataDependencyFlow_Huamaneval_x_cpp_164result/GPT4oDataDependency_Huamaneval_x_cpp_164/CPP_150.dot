Label: unknown

Explanation: The variables in question are not explicitly defined in the provided IR code, as the query refers to [VAR_NAME1] in [FUNCTION_NAME1] and [VAR_NAME2] in [FUNCTION_NAME2], but the actual names of the variables and functions are not provided. The IR shows operations and variable manipulations, but without specific variable names or functions to analyze, we cannot determine if there are any data dependencies. The presence of intermediate variables and control flow makes it difficult to ascertain direct dependencies. Therefore, it is unclear if any data dependency exists between the specified variables.

DOT File Representation:
```
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    
    "[FUNCTION_NAME1]:[VAR_NAME1]" -> "[FUNCTION_NAME2]:[VAR_NAME2]" [label="unknown dependency"];
}
``` 

This representation acknowledges the lack of clarity regarding dependencies due to the absence of specific variable names or functions in the query.
