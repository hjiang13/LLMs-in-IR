Explanation: The variable `%5` in the function `@_Z6digitsi` is data-dependent on the variable `%10` in the same function due to the series of operations involving the loading and manipulation of data. Specifically, `%5` is loaded from a memory location and is subsequently used in various arithmetic operations as well as conditional checks (e.g., `%10 = and i64 %5, 1`). The result of this operation influences the control flow and subsequent computations, confirming that there is a clear data dependency relationship between these two variables.
