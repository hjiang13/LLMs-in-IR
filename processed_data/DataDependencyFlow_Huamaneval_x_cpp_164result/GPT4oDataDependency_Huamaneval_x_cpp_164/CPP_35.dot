Label: unknown

Explanation: The data dependency relationship between the specified variables cannot be determined with certainty based on the provided IR code. While there are operations involving multiple variables, the specific variables in question were not explicitly defined in the context of the provided code. The code contains several operations, including loads and comparisons, but without knowing the exact names of [VAR_NAME1] and [VAR_NAME2], it is unclear how they relate to one another. Additionally, the usage of phi nodes introduces potential multiple paths of execution, making it difficult to ascertain a direct dependency without further context.

DOT File Representation:
```
digraph DataDependency {
    node [shape=box];
    
    "Unknown Function:VAR_NAME1" -> "Unknown Function:VAR_NAME2" [label="unspecified dependency"];
}
``` 

This representation reflects the uncertainty around the specific variables and functions involved. It indicates a lack of clear data dependency due to the absence of specific variable names in the provided IR code.
