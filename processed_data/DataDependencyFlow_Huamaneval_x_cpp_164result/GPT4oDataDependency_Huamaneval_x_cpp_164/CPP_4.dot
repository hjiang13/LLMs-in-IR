Label: unknown

Explanation: The variable dependencies in the provided IR code are complex. While there are numerous operations involving variables, the specific query does not provide the names of the variables [VAR_NAME1] and [VAR_NAME2] or the functions they belong to. Therefore, it's challenging to ascertain a data dependency relationship. For a definitive answer, more context regarding the specific variables and their usage in the respective functions is required. The intricate flow of operations and the multiple phi nodes suggest that while there may be dependencies, they could be indirect or conditional based on the control flow.

    "[FUNCTION_NAME1]:[VAR_NAME1]" -> "[FUNCTION_NAME2]:[VAR_NAME2]" [label="unknown dependency"];
    "[FUNCTION_NAME1]" -> "[FUNCTION_NAME2]" [label="function interaction"];
