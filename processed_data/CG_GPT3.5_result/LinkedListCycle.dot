Here is the Call Graph based on the provided IR code:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    node [shape=rectangle]
    
    "HasCycleP4Node"
    "main"
    "_GLOBAL__sub_I_LinkedListCycle.cpp"

    "main" -> "freopen"
    "main" -> "_Znwm"
    "main" -> "llvm.memset.p0i8.i64"
    "main" -> "_ZSt16__ostream_insertIcSt11char_traitsIcEERSt13basic_ostreamIT_T0_ES6_PKS3_l"
    "_GLOBAL__sub_I_LinkedListCycle.cpp" -> "ZNSt8ios_base4InitC1Ev"
    "_GLOBAL__sub_I_LinkedListCycle.cpp" -> "__cxa_atexit"
}
```

This is a simplified representation of the Call Graph. Each node represents a function from the IR code.
