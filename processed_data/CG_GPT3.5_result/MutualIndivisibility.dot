Here is the Call Graph in dot format:

```
digraph CallGraph {
    "main"
    "_ZNSt8ios_base4InitC1Ev"
    "_ZNSt8ios_base4InitD1Ev"
    "__cxa_atexit"
    "freopen"
    "__isoc99_scanf"
    "printf"
    "putc"
    "_GLOBAL__sub_I_MutualIndivisibility.cpp"
    
    "main" -> "freopen"
    "main" -> "__isoc99_scanf"
    "main" -> "printf"
    "main" -> "putc"
    "main" -> "_GLOBAL__sub_I_MutualIndivisibility.cpp"
    "_GLOBAL__sub_I_MutualIndivisibility.cpp" -> "_ZNSt8ios_base4InitC1Ev"
    "_GLOBAL__sub_I_MutualIndivisibility.cpp" -> "__cxa_atexit"
}
```
