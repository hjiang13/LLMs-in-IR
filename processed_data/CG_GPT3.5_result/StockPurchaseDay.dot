Here is the Call Graph:

```dot
digraph CallGraph {
    node [shape=rectangle];
    "solve" [label="solve"]
    "main" [label="main"]
    "_GLOBAL__sub_I_StockPurchaseDay.cpp" [label="_GLOBAL__sub_I_StockPurchaseDay.cpp"]
    "freopen" [label="freopen"]
    "__isoc99_scanf" [label="__isoc99_scanf"]
    "printf" [label="printf"]

    "main" -> "freopen"
    "main" -> "__isoc99_scanf"
    "main" -> "solve"
    "main" -> "__isoc99_scanf"
    "main" -> "printf"
    "_GLOBAL__sub_I_StockPurchaseDay.cpp" -> "_ZNSt8ios_base4InitC1Ev"
    "_GLOBAL__sub_I_StockPurchaseDay.cpp" -> "__cxa_atexit"
}
```
