Here is a decompiled equivalent C code representation of the provided LLVM IR. The original code seems to be implementing a counting sort algorithm that reads integers from an input file and counts occurrences, followed by displaying the counts. 

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#define MAX_VALUE 100

int main() {
    int n;
    int *counts;

    // Open the input file
    freopen("../input_files/counting_sort2", "r", stdin);

    // Read the number of elements
    scanf("%d", &n);

    // Allocate memory for counts array
    counts = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));
    if (counts == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation failed\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // Initialize counts array to 0
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        counts[i] = 0;
    }

    // Read each number and count occurrences
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int value;
        scanf("%d", &value);
        if (value < MAX_VALUE) {
            counts[value]++;
        }
    }

    // Output the counts
    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_VALUE; i++) {
        if (counts[i] > 0) {
            printf("%d: %d\n", i, counts[i]);
        }
    }

    // Free allocated memory
    free(counts);

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- The program begins by including necessary headers (`stdio.h` for input/output functions and `stdlib.h` for memory allocation).
- The `main` function is defined, which is the entry point of the program.
- It uses `freopen` to redirect standard input from a specified file.
- It reads an integer `n` that represents the number of elements to be processed.
- It allocates an array `counts` to keep track of the occurrences of each integer.
- The program initializes the `counts` array to zero and then reads integers, updating their corresponding counts.
- Finally, it prints the counts of each integer from 0 to 99 and frees the allocated memory before exiting.

### Notes:
- The code assumes the input file exists at the specified path and contains valid integers.
- Adjustments may be needed depending on the exact nature of the input and any additional requirements.
