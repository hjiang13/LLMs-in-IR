To create a data flow graph from the provided Intermediate Representation (IR) code, we will outline the basic structure including nodes for each basic block and edges that represent control flow between these blocks. 

Here, I will provide a DOT representation of the data flow graph based on the control flow in the `main` function of the IR code provided. The primary focus will be on the basic blocks and their relationships.

```dot
digraph DataFlowGraph {
    // Nodes representing the basic blocks
    block0 [label="Entry"];
    block1 [label="Block 1"];
    block2 [label="Block 2"];
    block3 [label="Block 3"];
    block4 [label="Block 4"];
    block5 [label="Block 5"];
    block6 [label="Block 6"];
    block7 [label="Block 7"];
    block8 [label="Block 8"];
    block9 [label="Block 9"];
    block10 [label="Block 10"];
    
    // Edges representing control flow
    block0 -> block1;
    block1 -> block3; // From %3 to %4
    block1 -> block2; // From %3 to %4
    block2 -> block6; // From %14 to %24
    block3 -> block4; // From %4 to %5
    block4 -> block5; // From %14 to %28
    block4 -> block6; // From %14 to %24
    block5 -> block7; // From %19 to %24
    block6 -> block8; // From %24 to %28
    block7 -> block9; // From %28 to %29
    block8 -> block9; // From %40 to %29
    block9 -> block10; // From %29 to %43
    block10 -> block1; // Return to %1
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Nodes**: Each node represents a basic block in the control flow.
- **Edges**: Directed edges represent the flow of control from one block to another.
- **Block Labels**: The labels are simplified to indicate their order or role in the flow, but they can be modified for clarity or detail.

This representation can be visualized using various graph visualization tools that support the DOT format.
