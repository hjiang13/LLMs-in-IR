There are 3 functions in the code: 
function[1] takes 3 inputs: string s1, string s2, string s3. function[1] is performing an XOR operation on two input strings and storing the result in a third string on s1, s2, s3, and outputs nothing.
function[2] takes 1 input: i8* ptr. function[2] is deallocating memory on ptr, and outputs nothing.
function[3] takes 5 inputs: string str, i64 pos, i64 len, i8* ptr, i64 size. function[3] is resizing the string on str, pos, len, ptr, size, and outputs nothing.
