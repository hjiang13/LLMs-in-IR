There are 2 functions in the code:
- Function[1] takes 2 inputs: vector<double> numbers, double x. Function[1] calculates a polynomial function on numbers and x, and outputs a double value.
- Function[2] takes 1 input: vector<double> numbers. Function[2] finds a zero in the vector by performing a series of mathematical operations on numbers, and outputs a double value.
