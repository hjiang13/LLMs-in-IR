There are 3 functions in the code: 
- function[1] takes 1 input: vector<float> numbers. function[1] is calculating the median of the elements in numbers and outputs a float value representing the median.
- function[2] takes 3 inputs: float* start, float* end, struct.__gnu_cxx::__ops::_Iter_less_iter* comparator. function[2] is performing introsort on the range defined by start and end using the comparator, and outputs void.
- function[3] takes 2 inputs: float* start, float* end. function[3] is performing final insertion sort on the range defined by start and end, and outputs void.
