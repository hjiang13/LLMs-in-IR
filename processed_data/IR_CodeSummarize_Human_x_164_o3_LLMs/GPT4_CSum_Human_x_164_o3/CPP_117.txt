There are 3 functions in the code: 
- function[1] takes 3 inputs: vector<string> words, string input, int length. function[1] is selecting words from the input based on the specified length and outputs vector<string> containing the selected words.
- function[2] takes 1 input: vector<string> words. function[2] is destroying the vector of words and outputs void.
- function[3] takes 2 inputs: vector<string> words, string word. function[3] is reallocating and inserting a word into the vector and outputs void.
