There are 5 functions in the code:
function[1] takes 2 inputs: vector<int> numbers, vector<int> otherNumbers. function[1] is sorting the elements of numbers based on the values in otherNumbers, and outputs void.
function[2] takes 2 inputs: vector<int> numbers, int value. function[2] is inserting value into the sorted position of numbers, and outputs void.
function[3] takes 2 inputs: vector<int> numbers, vector<int> otherNumbers. function[3] is performing a final insertion sort on numbers based on the values in otherNumbers, and outputs void.
function[4] takes 2 inputs: vector<int> numbers, vector<int> otherNumbers. function[4] is creating a heap from numbers based on the values in otherNumbers, and outputs void.
function[5] takes 2 inputs: vector<int> numbers, int threshold. function[5] is checking if any two elements in the vector are closer to each other than the given threshold on numbers, threshold, and outputs a boolean value indicating if such elements exist.
