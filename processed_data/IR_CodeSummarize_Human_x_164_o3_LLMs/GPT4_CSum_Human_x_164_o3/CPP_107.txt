There are 2 functions in the code:
- function[1] takes 2 inputs: vector<float> numbers, int size. function[1] is initializing the vector with size elements and outputs void.
- function[2] takes 2 inputs: vector<float> numbers, int index. function[2] is checking if the element at the given index is even or odd and outputs void.
