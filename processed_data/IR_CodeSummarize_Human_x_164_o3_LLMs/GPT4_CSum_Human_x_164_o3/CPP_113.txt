There are 4 functions in the code:
- function[1] takes 2 inputs: vector<string> strings, vector<string> result. function[1] is counting the number of odd elements in the input vector of strings, strings, and outputs a vector<string> containing the results.
- function[2] takes 1 input: vector<string> input. function[2] is reallocating and inserting elements into the vector, input, and outputs void.
- function[3] takes 1 input: vector<string> input. function[3] is destructing the vector, input, and outputs void.
- function[4] takes 2 inputs: vector<string> input, string format. function[4] is formatting the output based on the input vector and format, and outputs a formatted string.
