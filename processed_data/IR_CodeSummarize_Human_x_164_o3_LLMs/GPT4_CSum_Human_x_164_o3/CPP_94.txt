There are 2 functions in the code:
- function[1] takes 1 input: vector<int> numbers.
- Function[1] is calculating the number of elements in the vector and outputs an integer value representing the count.

- function[2] takes 2 inputs: vector<int> numbers, int threshold.
- Function[2] is checking if any two elements in the vector are closer to each other than the given threshold on numbers, threshold, and outputs a boolean value indicating if such elements exist.
