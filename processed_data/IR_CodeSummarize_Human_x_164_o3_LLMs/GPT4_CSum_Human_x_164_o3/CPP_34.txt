There are 3 functions in the code:
- function[1] takes 2 inputs: vector<int> numbers, vector<int> other_numbers. function[1] is merging the two vectors into one and outputs void.
- function[2] takes 1 input: vector<int> numbers. function[2] is sorting the vector in ascending order and outputs void.
- function[3] takes 2 inputs: vector<int> numbers, int value. function[3] is checking if the value exists in the vector and outputs a boolean value indicating its existence.
