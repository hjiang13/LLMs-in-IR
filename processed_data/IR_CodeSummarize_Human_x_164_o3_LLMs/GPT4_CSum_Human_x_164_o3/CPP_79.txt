There are 3 functions in the code:
- function[1] takes 2 inputs: vector<string> s, int number. function[1] is converting a decimal number to its binary representation on s, number, and outputs void.
- function[2] takes 1 inputs: vector<string> s. function[2] is appending a string to the vector on s, and outputs void.
- function[3] takes 2 inputs: vector<string> s, const char* format. function[3] is formatting a string based on the given format and appending it to the vector on s, format, and outputs void.
