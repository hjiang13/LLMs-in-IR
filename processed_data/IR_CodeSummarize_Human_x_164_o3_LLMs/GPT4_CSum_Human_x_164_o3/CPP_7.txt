There are 3 functions in the code:
- function[1] takes 3 inputs: vector<string> strings, vector<string> filtered, string substring. function[1] is filtering the strings in the vector based on the presence of the substring and outputs void.
- function[2] takes 1 input: vector<string> strings. function[2] is destructing the vector and outputs void.
- function[3] takes 1 input: string str. function[3] is terminating the program and outputs void.
