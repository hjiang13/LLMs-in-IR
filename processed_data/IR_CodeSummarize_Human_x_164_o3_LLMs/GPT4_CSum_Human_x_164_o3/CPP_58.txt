There are 5 functions in the code:
- function[1] takes 3 inputs: vector<int> vec1, vector<int> vec2, vector<int> result. function[1] is merging vec1 and vec2 into result.
- function[2] takes 2 inputs: vector<int> numbers, int size. function[2] is sorting the elements in numbers.
- function[3] takes 1 inputs: vector<int> numbers. function[3] is finding the maximum element in numbers and outputs the maximum value.
- function[4] takes 1 inputs: vector<int> numbers. function[4] is finding the minimum element in numbers and outputs the minimum value.
- function[5] takes 2 inputs: vector<int> numbers, int value. function[5] is checking if value exists in numbers and outputs a boolean indicating its presence.
