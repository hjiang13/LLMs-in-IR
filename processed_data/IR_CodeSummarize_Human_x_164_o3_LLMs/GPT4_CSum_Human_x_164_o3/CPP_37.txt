There are 3 functions in the code:
- function[1] takes 2 inputs: vector<float> numbers, vector<float> sorted_numbers. function[1] is sorting the elements of numbers in ascending order, and outputs void.
- function[2] takes 2 inputs: vector<float> numbers, float threshold. function[2] is checking if any two elements in the vector are closer to each other than the given threshold on numbers, threshold, and outputs a boolean value indicating if such elements exist.
- function[3] takes 2 inputs: vector<float> numbers, vector<float> sorted_numbers. function[3] is performing a final insertion sort on the sorted_numbers, and outputs void.
