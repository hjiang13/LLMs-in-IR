There are 5 functions in the code: 
- function[1] takes 3 inputs: vector<std::string> strings, std::string str1, std::string str2. function[1] is inserting str1 and str2 into the vector of strings, and outputs void.
- function[2] takes 1 inputs: vector<std::string> strings. function[2] is destructing the vector of strings, and outputs void.
- function[3] takes 3 inputs: vector<std::string> strings, std::string str1, std::string str2. function[3] is copying elements from str1 and str2 into the vector of strings, and outputs void.
- function[4] takes 2 inputs: vector<std::string> strings, std::string str. function[4] is reallocating space in the vector of strings to insert str, and outputs void.
- function[5] takes 2 inputs: vector<std::string> strings, std::string str. function[5] is checking if str is already present in the vector of strings, and outputs a boolean value indicating if str exists.
