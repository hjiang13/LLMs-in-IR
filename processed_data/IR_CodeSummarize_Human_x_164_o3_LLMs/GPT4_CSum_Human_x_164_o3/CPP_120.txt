There are 3 functions in the code: 
- function[1] takes 3 inputs: vector<int> numbers, vector<int> numbers, int size. function[1] is finding the maximum value from the given vector of integers, numbers, size, and outputs void.
- function[2] takes 2 inputs: vector<int> numbers, int size. function[2] is performing introsort on the given vector of integers, numbers, size, and outputs void.
- function[3] takes 2 inputs: vector<int> numbers, int size. function[3] is performing final insertion sort on the given vector of integers, numbers, size, and outputs void.
