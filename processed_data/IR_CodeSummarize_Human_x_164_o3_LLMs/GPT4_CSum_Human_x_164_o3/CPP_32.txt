There are 2 functions in the code: 
- function[1] takes 2 inputs: vector<double> numbers, double x. function[1] is calculating the polynomial value based on the elements in the vector and the input x, and outputs a double value representing the result of the polynomial evaluation.
- function[2] takes 1 input: vector<double> numbers. function[2] is finding the zero of the polynomial represented by the elements in the vector, and outputs a double value representing the zero found.
