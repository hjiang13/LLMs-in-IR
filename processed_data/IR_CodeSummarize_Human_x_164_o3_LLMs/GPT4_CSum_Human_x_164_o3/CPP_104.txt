There are 3 functions in the code:
- function[1] takes 2 inputs: vector<int> numbers, vector<int> unique_numbers. function[1] is generating a list of unique digits from the input numbers, and outputs void.
- function[2] takes 2 inputs: vector<int> numbers, int threshold. function[2] is checking if any two elements in the vector are closer to each other than the given threshold on numbers, threshold, and outputs a boolean value indicating if such elements exist.
- function[3] takes 2 inputs: vector<int> numbers, int size. function[3] is sorting the elements of the vector in ascending order, and outputs void.
