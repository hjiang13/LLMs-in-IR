There are 3 functions in the code: 
- function[1] takes 3 inputs: vector<string> output, vector<string> input, string prefix. function[1] is filtering the input vector by the given prefix and outputs the filtered results in the output vector.
- function[2] takes 1 input: vector<string> vec. function[2] is destructing the vector and outputs nothing.
- function[3] takes 1 input: vector<string> vec. function[3] is reallocating memory for the vector and outputs nothing.
