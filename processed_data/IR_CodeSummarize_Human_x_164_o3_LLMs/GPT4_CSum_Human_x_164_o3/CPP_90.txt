There are 3 functions in the code: 
- function[1] takes 1 input: vector<int> numbers. 
- Function[1] is finding the next smallest element in the vector numbers and outputs an integer value representing that element.

- function[2] takes 2 inputs: vector<int> numbers, int size. 
- Function[2] is performing introsort on the vector numbers of given size and outputs nothing.

- function[3] takes 2 inputs: vector<int> numbers, int size. 
- Function[3] is performing final insertion sort on the vector numbers of given size and outputs nothing.
