There are 3 functions in the code:
- function[1] takes 1 input: vector<int> numbers. function[1] is searching for an element in the vector and outputs an integer representing the index of the found element or -1 if not found.
- function[2] takes 1 input: vector<vector<int>> nested_numbers. function[2] is managing the memory of the nested vector and outputs nothing.
- function[3] takes 2 inputs: vector<vector<int>> nested_numbers, vector<int> numbers. function[3] is reallocating and inserting elements into the nested vector based on the input vector and outputs nothing.
