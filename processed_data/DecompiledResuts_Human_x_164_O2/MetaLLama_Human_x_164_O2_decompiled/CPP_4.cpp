Here is the C source code generated from the LLVM IR code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <math.h>

float mean_absolute_deviation(float *vector, int length) {
    if (length == 0) {
        return 0.0f;
    }

    float sum = 0.0f;
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        sum += vector[i];
    }

    float mean = sum / length;

    float sum_abs_diff = 0.0f;
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        sum_abs_diff += fabs(vector[i] - mean);
    }

    return sum_abs_diff / length;
}
```

Please note that I've assumed that the input is a float array and its length, not a C++ vector as in the original C++ code that generated this IR. If you want me to generate C++ code with std::vector, please let me know. 

Also note that I've used `fabs` function to calculate the absolute difference. If you want to keep the original behavior of `llvm.fabs.f32` intrinsic, you can replace `fabs` with your own implementation of floating-point absolute value function. 

Please note that I didn't preserve the original TBAA (Type-Based Alias Analysis) metadata and the "no-trapping-math" attribute, because C language does not provide direct access to this kind of low-level details. 

Also, the generated code is not guaranteed to have exactly the same performance characteristics as the original IR code, since it's a high-level language representation of the computation.
