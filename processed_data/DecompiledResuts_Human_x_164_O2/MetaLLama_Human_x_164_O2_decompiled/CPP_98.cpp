Based on the provided LLVM IR code, I will generate the equivalent C source code. Please note that the generated C code may not be perfect and might require some manual adjustments.

```c
#include <string.h>

int count_upper(const char* str) {
    const char* s = "AEIOU";
    int count = 0;
    int len = strlen(str);

    if (len == 0) return 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < len / 2; i++) {
        char c = str[i * 2];
        if (c == s[0] || c == s[1] || c == s[2] || c == s[3] || c == s[4]) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    if (len % 2 != 0) {
        char c = str[len - 1];
        if (c == s[0] || c == s[1] || c == s[2] || c == s[3] || c == s[4]) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    return count;
}
```

Note that the generated C code only includes the `count_upper` function, which is the main function of interest in the provided LLVM IR code. The other functions and declarations in the IR code are not relevant to the main functionality and are therefore not included in the generated C code.
