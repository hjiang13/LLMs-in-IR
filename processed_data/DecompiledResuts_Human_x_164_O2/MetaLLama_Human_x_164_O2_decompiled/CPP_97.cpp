Based on the provided LLVM IR code, I will generate the equivalent C source code. Here it is:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int multiply(int a, int b) {
    a = (a < 0) ? -a : a;
    b = (b < 0) ? -b : b;
    return (a % 10) * (b % 10);
}
```

Note that the `llvm.abs.i32` function calls have been replaced with simple conditional statements to calculate the absolute values of the input integers. Also, the `urem` instructions have been replaced with the modulo operator (`%`).
