Based on the provided LLVM IR code, I will generate the equivalent C source code. Here is the output:

```c
int car_race_collision(int x) {
  return x * x;
}
```

Note that I've only extracted the relevant function definition from the IR code and translated it into C syntax. Let me know if you have any further requests!
