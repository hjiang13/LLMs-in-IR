Based on the provided LLVM IR code, I will generate the equivalent C source code. Here it is:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int iscuber(int x) {
    int abs_x = (x < 0) ? -x : x;
    int i = 0;
    while (1) {
        long long cube = (long long)i * i * i;
        if (cube >= abs_x) break;
        i++;
    }
    return cube <= abs_x;
}
```

Please note that I've used the `long long` type to avoid potential integer overflow issues when calculating the cube. 

Also, I've used a simple while loop to implement the loop from the IR code, as the IR code's loop is not a straightforward for loop. The loop condition and the increment operation are implemented as closely as possible to the IR code. 

Please let me know if you need any further modifications.
