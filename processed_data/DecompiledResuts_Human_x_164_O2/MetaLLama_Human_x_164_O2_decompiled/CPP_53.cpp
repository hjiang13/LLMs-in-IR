Based on the provided LLVM IR code, here is the equivalent C source code:

```c
int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

Note that I've removed the unnecessary attributes and metadata from the IR code and only kept the essential function definition. The resulting C code is a simple function named `add` that takes two `int` arguments and returns their sum.
