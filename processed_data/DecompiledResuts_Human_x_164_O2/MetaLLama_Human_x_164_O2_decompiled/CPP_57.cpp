Based on the provided LLVM IR code, I will generate the equivalent C source code. Here it is:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct {
    float* data;
    float* begin;
    float* end;
} VectorImplData;

typedef struct {
    VectorImplData impl;
} VectorBase;

typedef struct {
    VectorBase base;
} Vector;

int monotonic(Vector* vec) {
    float* begin = vec->base.impl.begin;
    float* end = vec->base.impl.end;
    int increasing = 0;
    int decreasing = 0;
    float prev = *begin;

    for (int i = 1; i < (end - begin) / sizeof(float); i++) {
        float current = *(begin + i);
        if (current > prev) {
            increasing = 1;
        } else if (current < prev) {
            decreasing = 1;
        }
        prev = current;
    }

    return increasing + decreasing != 2;
}
```

Please note that this C code is a direct translation of the provided LLVM IR code. The original C++ code from which the IR was generated might have used the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) and thus looked significantly different. 

Also, please note that the generated C code may not be compilable as is, as the original IR code seems to be a part of a larger program. You may need to add necessary header files, function declarations, or other code to make it compilable. 

Finally, keep in mind that the C code may not be optimal or idiomatic, as it is a direct translation of the IR code. It is recommended to review and refactor the code to make it more readable, maintainable, and efficient.
