Based on the provided LLVM IR code, I will generate the equivalent C source code. Here it is:

```c
#include <stdint.h>

typedef struct {
    uint64_t _M_dataplus_size;
    uint64_t _M_dataplus_capacity;
} _Alloc_hider;

typedef struct {
    _Alloc_hider _M_hider;
    uint64_t _M_string_length;
    char _M_data[];
} basic_string;

int32_t strlen(basic_string *s) {
    return (int32_t)s->_M_string_length;
}
```

Please note that the generated C code is a simplified representation of the original C++ code and may not be fully functional or compatible with the original code. The LLVM IR code appears to be generated from a C++ program that uses the `std::string` class, which has been simplified to a struct in the generated C code.
